Description: # OnePassword python client
        [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/wandera/1password-client.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/wandera/1password-client)
        
        Python wrapper around 1Password password manager for usage within python scripts and
        Jupyter Notebooks. Developed by Data Scientists from Wandera to be used within both 
        research and python services use cases.
        
        
        ## Installation
        ```bash
        pip install 1password
        ```
        
        
        ## Basic Usage
        Currently fully tested on Mac OS.
        
        On first usage users will be asked for both the enrolled email, secret key and master 
        password. Mac OS users will also be prompted with installation windows to ensure you have the latest version of `op`.
        
        For all following usages you will only be asked for a master password.
        
        You will be given 3 attempts and then pointed to reset password documentation or alternatively you can
        restart your kernel.
        
        No passwords are stored in memory without encryption.
        
        ```python
        from onepassword import OnePassword
        import json
        
        op = OnePassword()
        
        # List all vaults 
        json.loads(op.list_vaults())
        
        # List all items in a vault, default is Private
        op.get_items()
        ```
        
        
        ## Contributing 
        The travis build will run with any PR or commit to master branch and then updates 
        the master branch with a new minor version for contributors to branch from.
        
        This means when contributing you should create a feature branch off of the master branch and without 
        manually bumping the version can focus on development. Merge back into master.
        
        Later admins will bump major versions.
        
        ## Roadmap
        - Fix and test Linux implementation
        - Add UTs
        - Add test docker image
        - Align response types into JSON / lists instead of JSON strings
        - Ensure full functionality of CLI in python
