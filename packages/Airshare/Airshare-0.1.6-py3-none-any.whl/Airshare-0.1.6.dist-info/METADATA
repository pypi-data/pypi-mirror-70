<p align="justify"><b>Airshare</b> is a Python-based CLI tool and module that lets you transfer data between two machines in a local network, P2P, using Multicast-DNS. It also opens an HTTP gateway for other non-CLI external interfaces. It works completely offline! Built with aiohttp and zeroconf.</p>

## Features

* Blazing fast content transfer within a local network.

* Lets you transfer plain text, send from or receive into your clipboard.

* Supports transfer of multiple files, directories and large files - content is sent chun$

* Lets you send files whose paths have been copied into the clipboard (more details in th$

* Cross-platform, works on Linux, Windows and Mac (CLI and Web Interface), and also suppo$

* Uses Multicast-DNS service registration and discovery - so you can access content with $

* Can be used as a module in other Python programs.

## Installation

* Install using `pip`

```bash
$ pip install Airshare
```

* Install using `pipx`

```bash
$ pipx install Airshare
```

* Install using Homebrew

```bash
$ brew install airshare
```

## Example

Send and receive files and directories.

To send using the CLI,

```bash
$ airshare noobmaster requirements.txt
```
To receive using the CLI,

```bash
$ airshare noobmaster
```

or visit `http://noobmaster.local:8000` in the browser to download.

You can also `import airshare` in any Python program. Visit the documentation for detailed usage instructions.

## Known Issues

* Link-local Name Resolution (for the `.local` addresses) on non-Apple devices requires Avahi (on Linux) or Bonjour (on Windows). Chances are you already have them, but if you don't, do check the web on how to install them.

* Android browsers do not have inbuilt Multicast-DNS service discovery, and cannot resolve the `.local` addresses. For this reason, we included QR Code support, for you to visit the URLs easily.

* Windows users with Python < 3.8, use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Break</kbd> to quit, as <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> will not work. This is a known issue with `asyncio`, which has been fixed in Python 3.8. If you do not have a <kbd>Break</kbd> key, try using <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Fn</kbd> + <kbd>B</kbd>, or check the web for other alternatives (depending on your PC).
