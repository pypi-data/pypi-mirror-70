Description: 
        Benevolent Blackjack is a cross-platform console-based program that plays a [game of Blackjack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackjack) with you, acting as the dealer and (optionally) any number of co-players.
        In addition to being able to play the role of an apathetic dealer, Benevolent Blackjack has two unique features: it can benevolently advise you on whether you are [making optimal decisions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackjack#Basic_strategy) to minimize the house edge, and it can train you to count cards.
