Description: 
        A USFM Bible editor using the [BibleOrgSys](https://pypi.org/project/BibleOrgSys/)
        library and Python's tKinter windowing library for simple and easy installation.
        (It's all in the standard CPython install.)
        
        On most systems, Biblelator can be installed (as shown above) with:
        
            `pip install Biblelator`
        
        but if it complains, maybe:
        
            `python3 -m pip install Biblelator`
        
        The app can be run from the command line with:
        
            `Biblelator`
        
        which should start up and display a smallish window,
        or to view all the available options:
        
            `Biblelator --help`
        
        You can discover the program version (doesn't match the package version) with:
        
            `Biblelator --version`
        
        Biblelator reads or creates a `BiblelatorData` folder in your home folder.
        Log files are stored in a subfolder there and may be useful for reporting errors.
        (If you have start-up problems, you might want to edit the settings there,
        or even delete the entire settings file if you have no complex saved windows settings yet.)
        
        Because some Bible users need to remain anonymous, Biblelator defaults to no internet use.
        However this reduces functionality, and most users will want to run the program once,
        and then close it and edit the `Biblelator.ini` file created in the `BiblelatorData/BiblelatorSettings` folder
        and change `internetAccess` to `Enabled`.
        While there, you might as well update the `currentUserName` and other entries
        under `[Users]`.
        
        The other auxilliary apps included are `BiblelatorSettingsEditor`,
        `BOSManager` (for inspecting Bible Organisational Systems), and
        `SwordManager` for viewing
        and downloading [Sword](https://crosswire.org/sword/index.jsp) modules.
        (All three are at various stages of incompleteness.)
        
        NOTE: This packaging is still being tested following massive restructuring,
        and is not necessarily fully functional until it is marked as v0.1.0 or higher
        when some open-licensed resources will also be downloadable.
        We also have hopes to improve documentation before v0.2.0.
        After that point, we also hope to release some prepackaged versions—
        probably including Docker and Snap.
        
        This software has been developed in very small chunks of spare time since 2013
        (so it's not necessarily well structured, and definitely not polished).
        However, it was used as my main Bible editor instead of Paratext
        for a couple of years.
        
        This package will not reach v1.0.0 until after the BibleOrgSys reaches it.
        The API will not become fixed/stable until the v1.0.0 release.
        
        No attempt at all has been made at memory or speed optimisations
        and this is not planned until after the release of v1.0.0.
        So if it becomes very slow, you might need to close some Bible resource windows.
        
        Biblelator is developed and tested on Linux (Ubuntu) but should also run on Windows and OS X (although not so well tested).
