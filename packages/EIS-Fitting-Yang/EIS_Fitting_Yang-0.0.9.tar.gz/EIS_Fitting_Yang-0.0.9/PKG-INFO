Description: # EIS_Fitting_Yang
        THis is a package for EIS fitting and plotting.
        Transmission line models are included in several equivalent circuits.
        The fitting curves of individual components in the circuit will be plotted under the overall fitting curve.
        
        The codes were written when work-from-home during the COVID-19 pandemic. Sincerely hope no more people dies from it.
