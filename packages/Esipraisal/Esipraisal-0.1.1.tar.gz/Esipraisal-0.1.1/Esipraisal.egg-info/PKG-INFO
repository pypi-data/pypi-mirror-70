Description: # Esipraisal
        
        Esipraisal is a simple tool designed to figure out the value of an item ("type" in the eve DB) based on several sources.
        
        
        ## To Use
        
        
        [Install with PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/Esipraisal/)
        
        
        ```python
        from Esipraisal import Esipraisal
        ep = Esipraisal()
        ep.appraise(type_id, region_ids)
        ```
        
        
        type_id = The id of the type you want to get the value of
        region_ids = a list of region ids in which you want to pull order information from.  Usefull if you say only want mineral prices in Delve.
        
        
        Returns: Appraisal object
        
        
        The Appraisal object includes the following info:
        
        
        * type = the type_id that was appraised
        * region_list = the list of region_ids from where the data was pulled
        * value = the estimated value of the type
        * volume = volume of orders
        * buy_value = average value of "buy" orders
        * sell_value = average value of "sell" orders
        * buy_volume = volume of "buy" orders
        * sell_volume = volume of "sell" orders
        * source = How the estimate was determined:
            * Market Orders - Most common, from market orders currently active
            * Historical Orders - Past orders which were recently completed, only used if there are not enough market orders for accurate data
            * CCP - CCP's estimate, only used if the above 2 are not valid
        
        Note: volumes listed may be different than those currently listed on market as the volume is after outlier removal has been done
