1.3.0
[FEATURE] French translation has been added (thanks to Olivier Faivre).
[FEATURE] Program structure has been changed: source code, as well as pictures
          and locale directory has been moved into src folder.
[FEATURE] METAR widget added.

          to group its content.
[FEATURE] Preferences, About and Error window behavior improved. All windows
          stays on top of main window all the time and main window does not
          accept input if preferences are open. What's more, it is not possible
          now to open multiple instances of Preferences and About windows.
[BUGFIX]  FGo! should not crash anymore if non Latin characters were entered
          in the paths in Preferences window or in command line options window.

          directory.
[FEATURE] ".config-base" file in "data" directory has been moved to

          the same file are now available for different languages.
[FEATURE] A new "presets" file added to "src/config" directory. It can hold
          predefined settings with which the program will be started if
          "~/.fgo/config" can't be find.
[BUGFIX]  "Reset" button will no longer affect "TerraSync" checkbutton state.
          It could in the past lead to erroneous indications on whether
          TerraSync is actually enabled or not.
[FEATURE] It is now possible for the airport list to display installed
          airports only. Appropriate controls have been added to
          Menu ==> Settings.
[BUGFIX]  Information about runways is now taken from ~/.fgo/apt database, not
          from scenery itself even if airport data source is set to "Scenery".
          Apparently, FlightGear is not reading threshold information from
          scenery even if property: /sim/paths/use-custom-scenery-data is
          set to true.
[FEATURE] A new window is shown to indicate that FlightGear is running.
[FEATURE] Help window was added. It is available at Menu ==> Help ==> Help.
          As a result, old readme file was moved into "src/help" directory,
          and renamed to "en". Different variants of help file are now
          available for different languages.
[FEATURE] FGo! can now be run from outside its main directory. Symbolic link to
          fgo file, or command like e.g. "python ~/fgo_main_folder/fgo" can
          now be used to launch the program from any location.
[FEATURE] Starting from now, version indication has been standardized. Every
          release is now marked with three digit number separated by dots.
          First two digits describes the version number, when last digit,
          describes the status of this version:
          Zero means that such release incorporates important new features,
          or major source code changes.
          Any other digit means that this is bug fixing release, or a small
          update, and it incorporates only small changes to source code,
          or changes to other files (e.g. translations).
...and (yes, you guessed it right! :D) many more minor changes and fixes.
