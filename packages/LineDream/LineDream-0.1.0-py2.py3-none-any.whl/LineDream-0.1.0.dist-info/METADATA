Scrawl is a creative coding library for Python. It is heavily influenced by P5 and Processing. However, it takes a more object oriented approach, with less global states.

Currently, output files are saved as SVGs. There is not yet support for a draw loop - it is single frame output, but you could use a loop to simulate this.

The library was originally created to make art for a pen plotter.
