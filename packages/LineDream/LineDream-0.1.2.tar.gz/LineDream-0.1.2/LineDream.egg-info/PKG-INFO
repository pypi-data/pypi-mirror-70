Description: 
        LineDream is a creative coding library for Python. It is heavily influenced by P5 and Processing. However, it takes a more object oriented approach, with less global states.
        
        Currently, output files are saved as SVGs. There is not yet support for a draw loop - it is single frame output, but you could use a loop to simulate this.
        
        The library was originally created to make art for a pen plotter, however, the inner object structure could be applied to many different rendering platforms.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        `pip install LineDream`
        
        Example
        -------
        ```python
        from LineDream import Circle, Canvas, Path
        Canvas.width = 400
        Canvas.height = 200
        
        
        Canvas.save('output.svg')
        ```
        
        Todos:
        -----
        - Integrate TextPath with Hershey
        - Convert all vertexes to Numpy arrays
        - Add .rotate()
        - Add .scale() (partially implemented in some classes)
