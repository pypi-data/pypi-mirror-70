
Integrate Ubox into Data portal

(*) a Ubox user "A" share a folder to another user "B" (see movie about how to do it)

(*) a Ubox user "B" receive the email with the sharing, copy/paste that link in Visus DataPortal. 
    Simply clicking on the email link is not enought for doing automatically conversion since this way you will be redirect to the Ubox default interface.
   

(*) The DataPortal page gets that link, redirect to the Ubox page for SingleSignOn (OAth2). it will redirect to a page like:

	redirect_uri=http://molniya.sci.utah.edu/visus/ubox?folder_id=<folder_id>
	https://app.box.com/api/oauth2/authorize?access_type=offline&client_id=<client_id>&redirect_uri=$redirect_uri&response_type=code
	
	(NOTE we need to enable this redirect in the ubox developer console!)
	
(*) User "B" login into Ubox account and grants permissions

(*) DataPortal will receive a "callback" with the authorization code. Something like:

	http://molniya.sci.utah.edu/visus/ubox?folder_id=<folder_id>&code=<authorization_code>
	
(*) Data portal will use this authorization code to get an <access_token>

(*) Now data portal can programmatically download files from the specific folder and convert to IDX

For details how to do it you have a self-contained python example (test.py)
In the comments you have also the curl equivalent to make network requests.
