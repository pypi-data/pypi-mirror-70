LONG_DESCRIPTION = """
Textable Prototypes collects text-analytic widgets that couldn't be included 
in the core Textable distribution for various reasons (notably because they 
introduce dependencies to third-party packages, or simply because they're not 
yet production-ready), but that may still be found useful by Orange 
Canvas/Textable users.
