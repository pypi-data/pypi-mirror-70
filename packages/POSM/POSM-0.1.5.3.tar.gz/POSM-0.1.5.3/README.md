# POSM - Python Editor for OpenStreetMap

May I introduce you to __POSM__, the Editor for [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org) data written in Python.
This should become the new state of the art editor for OpenStreetMap.
In contrast to the other common OSM editors this editor is based on Python.
Python is modern, has a huge user base and is battery-included.
This allows everyone to contribute to this project.
POSM uses the widespread, powerful and freshly-looking Qt-framework.

OpenStreetMap is a trademark of the OpenStreetMap Foundation, and is used with their permission. POSM is not endorsed by or affiliated with the OpenStreetMap Foundation.

Currently POSM is more like a prove of concept than a full fledged editor.
But it can already be used to modify OSM nodes.
