# POSM - Python Editor for OpenStreetMap

May I introduce you to __POSM__, the Python Editor for [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org).
This should become the new state of the art editor for OpenStreetMap.
In contrast to the other common OSM editors this editor is based on Python.
Python is modern, has a huge user base and is battery-included.
This allows everyone to contribute to this project.
POSM uses the widespread, powerful and freshly-looking Qt-framework.

Currently POSM is more like a prove of concept than a full fledged editor.
But it can already be used to modify OSM nodes.
