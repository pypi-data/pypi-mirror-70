# What it is

The purpose of this library is to support working with the OpenSource
CFD-toolbox [OpenFOAM](http://www.openfoam.org) and its forks

This [Python](http://www.python.org) library can be used to

-   analyze the logs produced by OpenFoam-solvers
-   execute OpenFoam-solvers and utilities and analyze their output
    simultaneously
-   manipulate the parameter files and the initial-conditions of a run
    in a non-destructive manner
-   plots the residuals of OpenFOAM solvers
-   lots of other stuff

Most of this functionality is made available to the user in the form
of command-line utilities.

PyFoam does all this strictly "from the outside": by writing parameter
files and reading the output of the solvers. Without compiled parts or
being linked to OpenFOAM.

More information is found on [the OpenFOAM Wiki](http://openfoamwiki.net/index.php/Contrib_PyFoam).
Introductory presentations on PyFoam can be found there
