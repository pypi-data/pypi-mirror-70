c  The plasmapause location and steepness are based on Carpenter and 
c  Anderson, 1992.  The values of a8 and a9 are used to define these
c  locations, respectively.  They are somewhat interdependent, however,
c  so the consequence of there being a magnetic local time dependence
c  for the plasmapause steepness is that both a8 and a9 must be
c  expressed as functions of MLT.  Figure 9(a) measurements were used
c  to obtain these fits.  Carpenter and Anderson's Section 3: Summary
c  equation #3 was not used, because it systemmatically increases
c  across 12 hours to 15 hours rather than peaking near 12 hours
c  as discussed in the text and is evident in their Figure 9(a).
c  As a result of fitting a sine wave function to Figure 9(a) of
c  Carpenter and Anderson [1992] the following is obtained
c		DELpp=0.0362*sin(mlt/12*pi-1.7015)
c  This fitted function is now shifted slightly to earlier MLT 
c  (by 0.4992 MLT) and used for finding fits for a8 and a9.
