c  This program calcuates the density profile for the interior
c  plasmasphere and for the emipirical modeling project.
c
c  The Carpenter and Anderson, 1992 plasmasphere is used only for a saturated plasmasphere.
c  For a more typical plasmaspheric density profile, we will use a profile obtained from
c  Gallagher et al. 1988
