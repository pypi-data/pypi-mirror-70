c
c  This subroutine models the plasmapause location and slope using a
c  modified Lorentzian function as the basis.  It returns a factor
c  that is used elsewhere to effect inclusion of the plasmapause
c  transition from the inner plasmasphere to the trough.

c  The factor returned varies from a value of 1 well inside a8
c  to a value of 0 well outside a8.
c
c  The rotation of the bulge with variation with Kpmax has been included
c
c  A plasmapause profile is obtained from Carpenter & Anderson [1991] combined
c  with Higel & Wu [1984] and Moldwin et al, [1994].
c  The profile is included in a8.
c
c  An average Kpmax dependence for the plasmapause slope is also included in
c  a9.
