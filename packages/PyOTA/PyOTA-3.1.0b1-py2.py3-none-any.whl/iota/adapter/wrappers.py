class RoutingWrapper(BaseWrapper):

    Routes commands (API requests) to different nodes depending on the command
    name.

    This allows you to, for example, send POW requests to a local node,
    while routing all other requests to a remote one.

    Once you've initialized the :py:class:`RoutingWrapper`, invoke its
    :py:meth:`add_route` method to specify a different adapter to use for a
    particular command.

    :param AdapterSpec default_adapter:
        RoutingWrapper must be initialized with a default URI/adapter.
        This is the adapter that will be used for any command that doesnâ€™t have
        a route associated with it.

    :return:
        :py:class:`RoutingWrapper` object.

    Example usage:

    .. code-block:: python

        from iota import Iota
        from iota.adapter.wrappers import RoutingWrapper

        # Route POW to localhost, everything else to 'https://nodes.thetangle.org:443'.
        api = Iota(
          RoutingWrapper('https://nodes.thetangle.org:443.'')
            .add_route('attachToTangle', 'http://localhost:14265')
            .add_route('interruptAttachingToTangle', 'http://localhost:14265')
        )

    .. note::

        A common use case for :py:class:`RoutingWrapper` is to perform
        proof-of-work on a specific (local) node, but let all other requests go to another node.
        Take care when you use :py:class:`RoutingWrapper` adapter and ``local_pow``
        parameter together in an API instance (see :py:class:`iota.Iota`), because the behavior might not
        be obvious.

        ``local_pow`` tells the API to perform proof-of-work (:py:meth:`iota.Iota.attach_to_tangle`)
        without relying on an actual node. It does this by calling an extension
        package `PyOTA-PoW <https://pypi.org/project/PyOTA-PoW/>`_ that does the
        job. In PyOTA, this means the request doesn't reach the adapter, it
        is redirected before.
        As a consequence,  ``local_pow`` has precedence over the route that is
        defined in :py:class:`RoutingWrapper`.
