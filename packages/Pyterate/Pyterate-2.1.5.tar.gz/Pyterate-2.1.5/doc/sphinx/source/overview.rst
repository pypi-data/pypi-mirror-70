What is Pyterate ?
--------------------

Pyterate is free and open source (*) |Sphinx|_ add-ons which provide two tools for |Python|_
projects.  The first one provides a Sphinx source generator based on the concept of literate
programming which can be used to make an example's based documentation.  The second one is a tool
similar to `sphinx-apidoc <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/man/sphinx-apidoc.html>`_ to generate
automatically the Sphinx sources for an API documentation using the `autodoc extension
<http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/ext/autodoc.html>`_.

.. * :ref:`Bibliography <bibliography-page>`

What are the features of the documentation generator ?
------------------------------------------------------

The documentation generator features:

.. https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax

 * intermixing of code, text, `LaTeX formulae <https://www.mathjax.org>`_, figures and plots
 * use the `reStructuredText <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReStructuredText>`_ or `Markdown
   <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown>`_ syntax for text
 * use the |Sphinx|_ generator
 * embed computations in the text content
 * generation of circuit schematics using |Circuit_macros|_
 * generation of figures using |Tikz|_
 * generation of plots using |Matplotlib|_

Somehow, it is similar to an `Jupyter notebook <https://ipython.org/notebook.html>`_, but it works
differently and provides specific features.
