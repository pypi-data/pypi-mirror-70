        # Soundboard
        
        Soundboard is a Python library for dealing with word pluralization.
        
        ## Installation
        
        Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install Soundboard.
        For windows:
        
        ```batch
        py -m pip install Soundboard
        ```
        For Mac/Linux:
        ```bash
        pip install Soundboard
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        ```python
        import Soundboard
        
        arr1 =[Soundboard.C ] #Note/Frequency
        arr2 =[4   ] #Amplitude
        arr3 =[100 ] #Duration
        Soundboard.render(arr1,arr2,arr3,"Test1")
        arr1 =[Soundboard.E ] #Note/Frequency
        arr2 =[4   ] #Amplitude
        arr3 =[100 ] #Duration
        Soundboard.render(arr1,arr2,arr3,"Test2")
        arr1 =[Soundboard.G ] #Note/Frequency
        arr2 =[4   ] #Duration
        arr3 =[100 ] #Amplitude
        Soundboard.render(arr1,arr2,arr3,"Test3")
        Soundboard.add("Test1","Test2","Test4")
        Soundboard.add("Test3","Test4","Combotest")
        Soundboard.make("Combotest")
        ```

        ## Documentation
        
        ### Render
        ```python
        Soundboard.render(frequency,duration,amplitude,filename)
        ```
        takes in an array of frequencies, and array of duration, and an array of amplitudes and a string filename
        #### Note: The arrays must be of equal length or else the program will halt with a notice.
        
        ### Add
        ```python
        Soundboard.add(track1,track2,output_file_name)
        ```
        takes in 2 track build files and outputs a new build file that includes both tracks merged together
        #### Note: You have to "make" the added files or else you will not be able to play the sound
        ### Build
        ```python
        Soundboard.build(arr)
        ```
        takes in an 2 dimensional array - an sequence of note arrays containing 3 values, frequency, duration, and amplitude
        ```python
        Soundboard.build([[frequency,duration,amplitude], ...])
        ```
        
        #### Note: The build will fail with an error if all 3 values are not filled in for each and every note.
        #### Note: Build will return a file called "Build.txt" containing numerical values for speaker positions
        
        ### Make
        ```python
        Soundboard.make(filename)
        ```
        takes in a filename
        #### Note: Compile will fail if there is no "Build.txt" in the current directory.
