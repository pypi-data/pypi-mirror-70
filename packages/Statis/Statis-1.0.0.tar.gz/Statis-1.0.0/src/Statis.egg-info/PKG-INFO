Description: # Statis
        
        **Statis** is a system info and monitoring tool based on desktop notifications.
        Its purpose is similar to that of traditional status bars or CLI tools, but
        with the explicit goal of staying out of the way while not being used – saving
        screen space and system resources. To this end, all its output occurs through
        your notification daemon, making it ideal for quick access via key bindings.

        ## Features
        
        * 10 built-in notifiers for resource usage (CPU, RAM, etc.), general info,
          [and more](#built-in-notifiers)
        * Notification-based output to enable more minimalist, status bar–less desktops
        * Process only runs for output or while monitoring, saving on system resources
        
        
        ## Installation
        
        ### Requirements
        
        * `Python 3.7+`
        * Your favorite notification daemon
        * `libnotify` (not required when using [`Dunst`](https://github.com/dunst-project/dunst))
        
        ### Stable Release
        
        ```shell
        pip install --user statis
        ```
        
        ### Development Version
        
        ```shell
        git clone https://gitlab.com/BVollmerhaus/statis
        cd statis
        pip install --user .
        ```
        
        
        ## Usage
        
        Each of Statis' outputs is provided by a corresponding notifier, multiple of
        which are generally grouped into modules.
        
        ```shell
        statis [options] [module [notifier] [notifier_args...]]
        ```
        
        A notifier is run by specifying its module and name. For example, the `memory`
        module's `used` notifier is invoked with:
        
        ```shell
        statis memory used
        ```
        
        If a notifier's name is identical to its containing module, it can also be
        invoked with just that:
        
        ```shell
        statis time
        ```
        
        Additional arguments may be passed to both `statis` and, if applicable, the
        invoked notifier:
        
        ```shell
        statis --urgency "low" date --format "Week %W"
        ```
        
        Note that `-h` may be passed to either `statis` or the notifier to list all
        supported arguments.
        
        
        ## Key Binding Examples
        
        Statis itself does not implement key binding; please use your DE/WM's native
        functionality for this. Some examples:
        
        ### i3
        
        ```
        bindsym $mod+c exec --no-startup-id statis cpu usage
        ```
        > Tip: i3's [binding modes](https://i3wm.org/docs/userguide.html#binding_modes)
        may be especially useful for this purpose.
        
        ### awesome
        
        ```lua
        awful.key({ modkey }, "c", function()
          awful.spawn("statis cpu usage", false)
        end)
        ```
        
        ### bspwm (sxhkd)
        
        ```
        super + c
            statis cpu usage
        ```
        
        
        ## Built-in Notifiers
        
        Statis currently includes the following notifiers (grouped by **`module`**):
        
        * **`battery`**
          - `charge`
        * **`cpu`**
          - `frequency`
          - `governor`
          - `usage`
        * **`date`**
        * **`memory`**
          - `free`
          - `free-swap`
          - `used`
          - `used-swap`
        * **`time`**
