Description: Sensing the environment:
        The Sense HAT has a set of environmental sensors for detecting the surrounding conditions; it can measure pressure, temperature, and humidity.
        
        Reading pressure with the Sense HAT
        Detecting temperature with the Sense HAT
        Detecting humidity with the Sense HAT
        Create a scrolling text display which keeps people informed about the current pressure, temperature, and humidity readings. You can use the scrolling text display code you wrote in the ‘Displaying text’ step to help you.
        Solution
        
        According to online documentation, the International Space Station maintains these conditions at the following levels:
        
        Temperature: 18.3-26.7 Celsius
        
        Pressure: 979-1027 millibars
        
        Humidity: around 60%
        
        Define variables for the colours green (0, 255, 0) and red (255, 0, 0).
        
        Use an if statement in your code to check whether the temperature is between 18.3 and 26.7 degrees Celsius.
