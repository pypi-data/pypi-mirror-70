Joy is a programming language created by Manfred von Thun that is easy to
use and understand and has many other nice properties.  This Python
package implements an interpreter for a dialect of Joy that attempts to
stay very close to the spirit of Joy but does not precisely match the
behaviour of the original version written in C.
