Description: # WARIO Pipeline Backend
        
        This library provides the backend to the WARIO pipeline development system. It can be used with any compatable pipeline file (see [WARIO Editor](https://github.com/McMasterRS/WARIO-Editor/)) and allows for the development of custom interfaces that can be directly linked to the pipeline code.
        
        ## Installation
        
        ```bash
        pip install wario
        ```
        
        ### Dependancies
        
        Python 3.6
        PyQt5
        blinker
        
        ## Usage
        
        To use WARIO independant of a frontend
        
        ```python
        from wario import PipelineThread
        
        
        pipeline = PipelineThread(filename)
        pipeline.start()
        
        ```
        
        WARIO pipelines can also be linked to interfaces through the use of blinker signals. For an example of this, see the [RunPipeline interface file in the WARIO Editor](https://github.com/McMasterRS/WARIO-Editor/blob/master/RunPipeline.py)
