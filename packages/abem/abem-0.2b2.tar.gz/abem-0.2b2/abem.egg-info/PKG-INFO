Description: # Acoustic Boundary Element Method (abem)
        
        AcousticBEM is a small library and example programs for solving the acoustic
        Helmholtz equation using the Boundary Element Method. The library is a
        re-implementation of the core components of Stephen Kirkup's ABEM Fortran
        library and its example programs. 
        The original Fortran code and the book "The Boundary Element Method in
        Acoustics" are available on his website: 
        <http://www.boundary-element-method.com/>.
