Description: # aiobroadlink
        Library to control various Broadlink devices using asyncio
        
        
        This software is based on the protocol description from Ipsum Domus (?)

        This software is based on python-broadlink by Matthew Garrett

        Remote Control device seem to be working alright (both IR and RF)
        
        RM4C are now supported.
        
        A1 device also work.
        
        Provisioning works.
        
        Other will be tested when I get the relevant hardware.
        
        Install with pip3. Be forwarned that aiobroadlink needs the 'cryptography' library.
        This library will be automatically installed, but for this to succeed, you do need to
        be able to compile things. To that effect you need a compiler and some header files. On
        Debian/Ubuntu distributions, this means you need the packages 'libffi-dev' and 'libssl-dev'
        
        You can run
        
            python3 -m aiobroadlink
        
        If your IP address cannot be guessed, do
        
            python3 -m aiobroadlink -i xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
        
        with xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx the IP address of the interface you want to use.
