Description: # Aliyun OSS store plugin for MLflow
        This repository provides a MLflow plugin that allows users to use a aliyun oss as the artifact store for MLflow.
        
        ## Implementation overview
        * `aliyunstoreplugin`: this package includes the `AliyunOssArtifactRepository` class that is used to read and write artifacts from Aliyun OSS storage.
        * `setup.py` file defines entrypoints that tell MLflow to automatically associate the `oss` URIs with the `AliyunOssArtifactRepository` implementation when the `aliyunstoreplugin` library is installed. The entrypoints are configured as follows:
        
        ```
        entry_points={
                "mlflow.artifact_repository": [
                    "oss=aliyunstoreplugin.store.artifact.aliyun_oss_artifact_repo:AliyunOssArtifactRepository"
                ]
            },
        ```
        
        
        # Usage
        To store artifacts in Aliyun OSS Storage, specify a URI of the form ``oss://<bucket>/<path>``.
        This plugin expects Aliyun Storage access credentials in the
        ``MLFLOW_OSS_ENDPOINT_URL``, ``MLFLOW_OSS_KEY_ID`` and ``MLFLOW_OSS_KEY_SECRET`` environment variables,
        so you must set these variables on both your client
        application and your MLflow tracking server. Finally, you must run ``pip install oss2``
        separately (on both your client and the server) to access Aliyun OSS Storage
