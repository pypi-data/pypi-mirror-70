        Installation
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        Pip install (recommended)
        -------------------------
        To install avro-to-python, run this command in your terminal:
        
        .. code-block:: console
        
            $ pip install avro-to-python
        
        Install From Source ()
        ----------------------
        
        The sources for avro-to-python can be downloaded source as well.
        
        Clone the public repository:
        
        .. code-block:: console
        
            $ git clone git://github.com/srserves85/avro-to-python
        
        
        Once you have a copy of the source, you can install it with:
        
        
        .. code-block:: console
        
            $ python setup.py install
        
        or
        
        .. code-block:: console
        
            $ pip install -e .
        
        
        Examples
        ^^^^^^^^
        
        Majority of the use of avro-to-python is assumed to be used as a cli, but you can still import and use the python classes under the hood as well.
        
        CLI (without --pip)
        -------------------
        To use the cli, here is the available cli commands:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            avro-to-python [source] [target]
                Options:
                    --pip TEXT              make package pip installable using this name
                    --author TEXT           author name of the pip installable package
                    --package_version TEXT  version of the pip intallable package  [default: 0.1.0]
                    --help                  Show this message and exit
        
        
        The above will compile the avsc files and convert the to python classes found in [path_to_target_directory]
        
        An example of doing this is the following:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            avro-to-python [path_to_source_avsc_files] [path_to_target_directory]
        
        
        If you run the above on a valid avro avsc file, you should then be able to import them as you would in the avro idl namespace Here is an example of a single avsc record from the namespace: *name.space* and name: *RecordClass*:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            from name.space import RecordClass
        
            record = RecordClass({'foo': True, 'bar': 'true', 'baz': 10, 'food': 'CHOCOLATE'})
        
        
        CLI (with --pip)
        ----------------
        You can also choose to make compiled avro packages ***pip installable*** by adding the "--pip" flags. An example of this is the following:
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            avro-to-python [path_to_source_avsc_files] [path_to_target_directory] --pip test_avro
        
        By running this, you should be able to pip install the above package you created from the target directory you specified by running:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            pip install -e path_to_target_directory
        
        Now that you have the package installed, you can import it by it's package name and namespace. Here is the same example of the same avsc from above, only with a pip package of *test_avro*:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            from test_avro.name.space import RecordClass
        
            record = RecordClass({'foo': True, 'bar': 'true', 'baz': 10, 'food': 'CHOCOLATE'})
        
        
        avro-to-python in a Script
        --------------------------
        You can also use the reader and writer packages in avro-to-python as you would any other python package. Avro to python is split between a *reader* and *writer* classes. avro-to-python treates namespaces as acyclic trees and uses depth first search to ensure no duplication or namespace collisions on read and write. An example useage is below:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            from avro_to_python.reader import AvscReader
            from avro_to_python.writer import AvroWriter
        
            # initialize the reader object
            reader = AvscReader(directory='tests/avsc/records/')
        
            # generate the acyclic tree object
            reader.read()
        
            # initialize the writer object
            writer = AvroWriter(reader.file_tree, pip='test_pip')
        
            # compile python files using 'tests/test_records as the namespace root'
            writer.write(root_dir='tests/test_records')
