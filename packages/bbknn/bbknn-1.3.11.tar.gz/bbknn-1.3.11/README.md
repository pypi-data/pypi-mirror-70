# Batch balanced KNN

BBKNN is a fast and intuitive batch effect removal tool that can be directly used in the [scanpy](https://scanpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) workflow. It serves as an alternative to `scanpy.api.pp.neighbors()`, with both functions creating a neighbour graph for subsequent use in clustering, pseudotime and UMAP visualisation. The standard approach begins by identifying the k nearest neighbours for each individual cell across the entire data structure, with the candidates being subsequently transformed to exponentially related connectivities before serving as the basis for further analyses. If technical artifacts (be they because of differing data acquisition technologies, protocol alterations or even particularly severe operator effects) are present in the data, they will make it challenging to link corresponding cell types across different batches.

As such, BBKNN actively combats this effect by splitting your data into batches and finding a smaller number of neighbours for each cell within each of the groups. This helps create connections between analogous cells in different batches without altering the counts or PCA space.

## Installation

BBKNN depends on Cython, numpy, scipy, annoy, umap-learn and scikit-learn. The package is available on pip and conda, and can be easily installed as follows:

	pip3 install bbknn

or

	conda install -c bioconda bbknn

BBKNN can also make use of faiss. Consult the [official installation instructions](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss/blob/master/INSTALL.md), the easiest way to get it is via conda.

## Usage and Documentation

BBKNN has the option to immediately slot into the spot occupied by `scanpy.api.neighbors()` in the [Seurat-inspired scanpy workflow](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/theislab/scanpy_usage/blob/master/170505_seurat/seurat.ipynb). It computes a batch aligned variant of the neighbourhood graph, with its uses within scanpy including clustering, diffusion map pseudotime inference and UMAP visualisation. The basic syntax to run BBKNN on scanpy's AnnData object (with PCA computed via `scanpy.api.tl.pca()`) is as follows:

	import bbknn
	bbknn.bbknn(adata)

You can provide which `adata.obs` column to use for batch discrimination via the `batch_key` parameter. This defaults to `'batch'`, which is created by scanpy when you merge multiple AnnData objects (e.g. if you were to import multiple samples separately and then concatenate them).

Alternately, you can just provide a PCA matrix with cells as rows and a matching vector of batch assignments for each of the cells and call BBKNN as follows (with `connectivities` being the primary graph output of interest):

	import bbknn
	distances, connectivities, parameters = bbknn.bbknn_pca_matrix(pca_matrix, batch_list)

An HTML render of the BBKNN function docstring, detailing all the parameters, can be accessed at [ReadTheDocs](https://bbknn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## BBKNN in R

At this point, there is no plan to create a BBKNN R package. However, it can be ran quite easily via reticulate. Using the base functions is the same as in python. If you're in possession of a PCA matrix and a batch assignment vector and want to get UMAP coordinates out of it, you can use the following code snippet to do so. The weird PCA computation part and replacing it with your original values is unfortunately necessary due to how AnnData innards operate from a reticulate level. Provide your python path in `use_python()`

	library(reticulate)
	use_python("/usr/bin/python3")

	anndata = import("anndata",convert=FALSE)
	bbknn = import("bbknn", convert=FALSE)
	sc = import("scanpy.api",convert=FALSE)

	adata = anndata$AnnData(X=pca, obs=batch)
	sc$tl$pca(adata)
	adata$obsm$X_pca = pca
	bbknn$bbknn(adata,batch_key=0)
	sc$tl$umap(adata)
	umap = py_to_r(adata$obsm$X_umap)

When testing locally, faiss refused to work when BBKNN was reticulated. As such, provide `use_faiss=FALSE` to the BBKNN call if you run into this problem.

## Example Notebooks

**[pancreas.ipynb](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Teichlab/bbknn/blob/master/examples/pancreas.ipynb) is the main demonstration, featuring in-depth annotation and a step by step description/comparison of BBKNN's available options.** 

The [BBKNN paper](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btz625) makes use of the following analyses:
- [simulation.ipynb](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Teichlab/bbknn/blob/master/examples/simulation.ipynb) applies BBKNN to simulated data with a known ground truth, and demonstrates the utility of graph trimming by introducing an unrelated cell population. This simulated data is then used to benchmark BBKNN against mnnCorrect, CCA, Scanorama and Harmony in [benchmark.ipynb](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Teichlab/bbknn/blob/master/examples/benchmark.ipynb), and then finish off with a benchmarking of a BBKNN variant reluctant to work within R/reticulate and visualise the findings in  [benchmark2.ipynb](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Teichlab/bbknn/blob/master/examples/benchmark2.ipynb). [benchmark3-new-R-methods.ipynb](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Teichlab/bbknn/blob/master/examples/benchmark3-new-R-methods.ipynb) adds some newer R approaches to the benchmark.
- [mouse.ipynb](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Teichlab/bbknn/blob/master/examples/mouse.ipynb) runs a collection of murine atlases through BBKNN. [mouse-harmony.ipynb](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Teichlab/bbknn/blob/master/examples/mouse-harmony.ipynb) applies Harmony to the same data.

The original [BBKNN preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/08/22/397042) performed a few more analyses that got ultimately removed.
