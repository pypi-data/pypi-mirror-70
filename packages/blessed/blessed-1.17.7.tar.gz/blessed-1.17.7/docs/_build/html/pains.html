<h1>Growing Pains<a class="headerlink" href="#growing-pains" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>When making terminal applications, there are a surprisingly number of
portability issues and edge cases.  Although Blessed provides an abstraction
for the full curses capability database, it is not sufficient to secure
you from several considerations shared here.</p>
<div class="section" id="and-16-colors">
<h2>8 and 16 colors<a class="headerlink" href="#and-16-colors" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>

<p><a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code#3/4_bit">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code#3/4_bit</a></p>
<p>As a curses library, I think we should safely assume to map our colorspace
to rgb values that match xterm.</p>
<p>XXX</p>
<p>Where 8 and 16 colors are used, they should be assumed to be the
<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_Graphics_Adapter#With_an_RGBI_monitor">CGA Color Palette</a>.  Though there is no terminal standard that proclaims
that the CGA colors are used, their values are the best approximations
across all common hardware terminals and terminal emulators.</p>
<p>A recent phenomenon of users is to customize their base 16 colors to provide
(often, more “washed out”) color schemes.  Furthermore, we are only recently
getting LCD displays of colorspaces that achieve close approximation to the
original video terminals.  Some find these values uncomfortably intense: in
their original CRT form, their contrast and brightness was lowered by hardware
dials, whereas today’s LCD’s typically display colors well near full intensity.</p>
<p>Though we may not <em>detect</em> the colorspace of the remote terminal, <strong>we can</strong>:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Trust that a close approximation of the <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_Graphics_Adapter#With_an_RGBI_monitor">CGA Color Palette</a> for the base
16 colors will be displayed for <strong>most</strong> users.</p></li>
<li><p>Trust that users who have made the choice to adjust their palette have made
the choice to do so, and are able to re-adjust such palettes as necessary
to accommodate different programs (such as through the use of “Themes”).</p></li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>It has become popular to use dynamic system-wide color palette adjustments
in software such as <a class="reference external" href="https://justgetflux.com/">f.lux</a>, “Dark Mode”, “Night Mode”, and others,
which adjust the system-wide “Color Profile” of the entire graphics display
depending on the time of day.  One might assume that <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">term.blue(&quot;text&quot;)</span></code>
may become <strong>completely</strong> invisible to such users during the night!</p>

<h2>Where is brown, purple, or grey?<a class="headerlink" href="#where-is-brown-purple-or-grey" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>There are <strong>only 8 color names</strong> on a 16-color terminal:  The second set of
eight colors are “high intensity” versions of the first in direct series.</p>
<p>The colors <em>brown</em>, <em>purple</em>, and <em>grey</em> are not named in the first series,
though they are available:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>brown</strong>: <em>yellow is brown</em>, only high-intensity yellow
(<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">bright_yellow</span></code>) is yellow!</p></li>
<li><p><strong>purple</strong>: <em>magenta is purple</em>.  In earlier, 4-bit color spaces, there
were only black, cyan, magenta, and white of low and high intensity, such
as found on common home computers like the <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_8-bit_computer_hardware_palettes#ZX_Spectrum">ZX Spectrum</a>.</p>
<p>Additional “colors” were only possible through dithering.  The color names
cyan and magenta on later graphics adapters are carried over from its
predecessors.  Although the color cyan remained true in RGB value on
16-color to its predecessor, magenta shifted farther towards blue from red
becoming purple (as true red was introduced as one of the new base 8
colors).</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>grey</strong>: there are actually <strong>three shades of grey</strong> (or American spelling,
‘gray’), though the color attribute named ‘grey’ does not exist!</p>
<p>In ascending order of intensity, the shades of grey are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">bold_black</span></code>: in lieu of the uselessness of an “intense black”, this is
color is instead mapped to “dark grey”.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">white</span></code>: white is actually mild compared to the true color ‘white’: this
is more officially mapped to “common grey”, and is often the default
foreground color.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">bright_white</span></code>: is pure white (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">#ffffff</span></code>).</p></li>

<h3>white-on-black<a class="headerlink" href="#white-on-black" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The default foreground and background should be assumed as <em>white-on-black</em>.</p>
<p>For quite some time, the families of terminals produced by DEC, IBM, and
Tektronix dominated the computing world with the default color scheme of
<em>green-on-black</em> and less commonly <em>amber-on-black</em> monochrome displays:
The inverse was a non-default configuration.  The IBM 3270 clients exclusively
used <em>green-on-black</em> in both hardware and software emulators, and is likely
a driving factor of the default <em>white-on-black</em> appearance of the first IBM
Personal Computer.</p>
<p>The less common <em>black-on-white</em> “ink paper” style of emulators is a valid
concern for those designing terminal interfaces.  The color scheme of
<em>black-on-white</em> directly conflicts with the intention of <a class="reference internal" href="#bold-is-bright">bold is bright</a>,
where <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">term.bright_red('ATTENTION!')</span></code> may become difficult to read,
as it appears as <em>pink on white</em>!</p>
<div class="section" id="history-of-ink-paper-inspired-black-on-white">
<h4>History of ink-paper inspired black-on-white<a class="headerlink" href="#history-of-ink-paper-inspired-black-on-white" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Early home computers with color video adapters, such as the Commodore 64
provided <em>white-on-blue</em> as their basic video terminal configuration.  One can
only assume such appearances were provided to demonstrate their color
capabilities over competitors (such as the Apple ][).</p>
<p>More common, X11’s xterm and the software HyperTerm bundle with MS Windows
provided an “ink on paper” <em>black-on-white</em> appearance as their default
configuration.  Two popular emulators continue to supply <em>black-on-white</em> by
default to this day: Xorg’s xterm and Apple’s Terminal.app.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>Windows no longer supplies a terminal emulator: the “command prompt”
as we know it now uses the MSVCRT API routines to interact and does not
make use of terminal sequences, even ignoring those sequences that MS-DOS
family of systems previously interpreted through the ANSI.SYS driver,
though it continues to default to <em>white-on-black</em>.</p>

<h2>Bold is bright<a class="headerlink" href="#bold-is-bright" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>Where Bold is used, it should be assumed to be *Bright*</strong>.</p>
<p>Due to the influence of early graphics adapters providing a set of 8
“low-intensity” and 8 “high intensity” versions of the first, the term
“bold” for terminals sequences is synonymous with “high intensity” in
almost all circumstances.</p>
<div class="section" id="history-of-bold-as-wide-stroke">
<h3>History of bold as “wide stroke”<a class="headerlink" href="#history-of-bold-as-wide-stroke" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In typography, the true translation of “bold” is that a font should be
displayed <em>with emphasis</em>.  In classical terms, this would be achieved by
pen be re-writing over the same letters.  On a teletype or printer, this was
similarly achieved by writing a character, backspacing, then repeating the
same character in a form called <strong>overstriking</strong>.</p>
<p>To bold a character, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">C</span></code>, one would emit the sequence <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">C^HC</span></code> where
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">^H</span></code> is backspace (0x08).  To underline <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">C</span></code>, one would would emit
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">C^H_</span></code>.</p>
<p><strong>Video terminals do not support overstriking</strong>.  Though the mdoc format for
manual pages continue to emit overstriking sequences for bold and underline,
translators such as mandoc will instead emit an appropriate terminal sequence.</p>
<p>Many characters previously displayable by combining using overstriking of
ASCII characters on teletypes, such as: ±, ≠, or ⩝ were delegated to a
<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_page">code page</a> or lost entirely until the introduction of multibyte encodings.</p>
<p>Much like the “ink paper” introduction in windowing systems for terminal
emulators, “wide stroke” bold was introduced only much later when combined
with operating systems that provided font routines such as TrueType.</p>

<div class="section" id="enforcing-white-on-black">
<h3>Enforcing white-on-black<a class="headerlink" href="#enforcing-white-on-black" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In conclusion, <em>white-on-black</em> should be considered the default.  If there is
a need to <strong>enforce</strong> <em>white-on-black</em> for terminal clients suspected to be
defaulted as <em>black-on-white</em>, one would want to trust that a combination of
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">term.home</span> <span class="pre">+</span> <span class="pre">term.white_on_black</span> <span class="pre">+</span> <span class="pre">term.clear</span></code> should repaint the entire
emulator’s window with the desired effect.</p>
<p>However, this cannot be trusted to <strong>all</strong> terminal emulators to perform
correctly!  Depending on your audience, you may instead ensure that the
entire screen (including whitespace) is painted using the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">on_black</span></code>
mnemonic.</p>

<div class="section" id="beware-of-customized-color-schemes">
<h2>Beware of customized color schemes<a class="headerlink" href="#beware-of-customized-color-schemes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A recent phenomenon is for users to customize these first 16 colors of their
preferred emulator to colors of their own liking.  Though this has always been
possible with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">~/.XResources</span></code>, the introduction of PuTTy and iTerm2 to
interactively adjustment these colors have made this much more common.</p>
<p>This may cause your audience to see your intended interface in a wildly
different form.  Your intended presentation may appear mildly unreadable.</p>
<p>Users are certainly free to customize their colors however they like, but it
should be known that displaying <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">term.black_on_red(&quot;DANGER!&quot;)</span></code> may appear
as “grey on pastel red” to your audience, reducing the intended effect of
intensity.</p>
<div class="section" id="colors-can-avoid-customization">
<h3>256 colors can avoid customization<a class="headerlink" href="#colors-can-avoid-customization" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The first instinct of a user who aliases ls(1) to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ls</span> <span class="pre">-G</span></code> or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">colorls</span></code>,
when faced with the particularly low intensity of the default <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">blue</span></code>
attribute is <strong>to adjust their terminal emulator’s color scheme of the base
16 colors</strong>.</p>
<p>This is not necessary: the environment variable <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">LSCOLORS</span></code> may be redefined
to map an alternative color for blue, or to use <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">bright_blue</span></code> in its place.</p>
<p>Furthermore, all common terminal text editors such as emacs or vim may be
configured with “colorschemes” to make use of the 256-color support found in
most modern emulators.  Many readable shades of blue are available, and many
programs that emit such colors can be configured to emit a higher or lower
intensity variant from the full 256 color space through program configuration.</p>

<div class="section" id="monochrome-and-reverse">
<h2>Monochrome and reverse<a class="headerlink" href="#monochrome-and-reverse" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Note that <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">reverse</span></code> takes the current foreground and background colors and
reverses them.  In contrast, the compound formatter <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">black_on_red</span></code> would
fail to set the background <em>or</em> foreground color on a monochrome display,
resulting in the same stylization as <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">normal</span></code> – it would not appear any
different!</p>
<p>If your userbase consists of monochrome terminals, you may wish to provide
“lightbars” and other such effects using the compound formatter
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">red_reverse</span></code>.  In the literal sense of “set foreground color to red, then
swap foreground and background”, this produces a similar effect on
<strong>both</strong> color and monochrome displays.</p>
<p>For text, very few <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">{color}_on_{color}</span></code> formatters are visible with the
base 16 colors, so you should generally wish for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">black_on_{color}</span></code>
anyway.  By using <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">{color}_reverse</span></code> you may be portable with monochrome
displays as well.</p>

<h2>Multibyte Encodings and Code pages<a class="headerlink" href="#multibyte-encodings-and-code-pages" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A terminal that supports both multibyte encodings (UTF-8) and legacy 8-bit
code pages (ISO 2022) may instruct the terminal to switch between both
modes using the following sequences:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">\x1b%G</span></code> activates UTF-8 with an unspecified implementation level
from ISO 2022 in a way that allows to go back to ISO 2022 again.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">\x1b%&#64;</span></code> goes back from UTF-8 to ISO 2022 in case UTF-8 had been
entered via <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">\x1b%G</span></code>.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">\x1b%/G</span></code> switches to UTF-8 Level 1 with no return.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">\x1b%/H</span></code> switches to UTF-8 Level 2 with no return.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">\x1b%/I</span></code> switches to UTF-8 Level 3 with no return.</p></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>When a terminal is in ISO 2022 mode, you may use a sequence
to request a terminal to change its <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_page">code page</a>.  It begins by <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">\x1b(</span></code>,
followed by an ASCII character representing a code page selection.  For
example <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">\x1b(U</span></code> on the legacy VGA Linux console switches to the <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_page_437">IBM CP437</a>
<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_page">code page</a>, allowing North American MS-DOS artwork to be displayed in its
natural 8-bit byte encoding.  A list of standard codes and the expected code

sequences following the <a class="reference external" href="http://invisible-island.net/xterm/ctlseqs/ctlseqs.html#h2-Controls-beginning-with-ESC">Control-Sequence-Inducer</a>.</p>

<a class="reference external" href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/">Markus Kuhn</a> of the University of
Cambridge.</p>
<p>One can be assured that the connecting client is capable of representing
UTF-8 and other multibyte character encodings by the Environment variable
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">LANG</span></code>.  If this is not possible or reliable, there is an intrusive detection

<div class="section" id="alt-or-meta-sends-escape">
<h2>Alt or meta sends Escape<a class="headerlink" href="#alt-or-meta-sends-escape" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Programs using GNU readline such as bash continue to provide default mappings
such as <em>ALT+u</em> to uppercase the word after cursor.  This is achieved
by the configuration option altSendsEscape or <a class="reference external" href="http://invisible-island.net/xterm/ctlseqs/ctlseqs.html#h2-Alt-and-Meta-Keys">metaSendsEscape</a></p>
<p>The default for most terminals, however, is that the meta key is bound by
the operating system (such as <em>META + F</em> for find), and that <em>ALT</em> is used
for inserting international keys (where the combination <em>ALT+u, a</em> is used
to insert the character <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ä</span></code>).</p>
<p>It is therefore a recommendation to <strong>avoid alt or meta keys entirely</strong> in
applications, and instead prefer the ctrl-key combinations, so as to avoid
instructing your users to configure their terminal emulators to communicate
such sequences.</p>
<p>If you wish to allow them optionally (such as through readline), the ability
to detect alt or meta key combinations is achieved by prefacing the combining
character with escape, so that <em>ALT+z</em> becomes <em>Escape + z</em> (or, in raw form
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">\x1bz</span></code>).  Blessings currently provides no further assistance in detecting
these key combinations.</p>

<h2>Backspace sends delete<a class="headerlink" href="#backspace-sends-delete" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Typically, backspace is <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">^H</span></code> (8, or 0x08) and delete is ^? (127, or 0x7f).</p>
<p>On some systems however, the key for backspace is actually labeled and
transmitted as “delete”, though its function in the operating system behaves
just as backspace.</p>
<p>It is highly recommend to accept <strong>both</strong> <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">KEY_DELETE</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">KEY_BACKSPACE</span></code>
as having the same meaning except when implementing full screen editors,
and provide a choice to enable the delete mode by configuration.</p>

<h2>The misnomer of ANSI<a class="headerlink" href="#the-misnomer-of-ansi" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>When people say ‘ANSI Sequence’, they are discussing:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Standard <a class="reference external" href="http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-048.htm">ECMA-48</a>: Control Functions for Coded Character Sets</p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="http://sydney.edu.au/engineering/it/~tapted/ansi.html">ANSI X3.64</a> from
1981, when the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.ansi.org/">American National Standards Institute</a> adopted the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-048.htm">ECMA-48</a> as standard, which was later
withdrawn in 1997 (so in this sense it is <em>not</em> an ANSI standard).</p></li>
<li><p>The <a class="reference external" href="http://www.kegel.com/nansi/">ANSI.SYS</a> driver provided in MS-DOS and
clones.  The popularity of the IBM Personal Computer and MS-DOS of the era,
and its ability to display colored text further populated the idea that such
text “is ANSI”.</p></li>
<li><p>The various code pages used in MS-DOS Personal Computers,
providing “block art” characters in the 8th bit (int 127-255), paired
with <a class="reference external" href="http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-048.htm">ECMA-48</a> sequences supported by the MS-DOS <a class="reference external" href="http://www.kegel.com/nansi/">ANSI.SYS</a> driver
to create artwork, known as <a class="reference external" href="http://pc.textmod.es/">ANSI art</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>The ANSI terminal database entry and its many descendants in the
<a class="reference external" href="http://invisible-island.net/ncurses/terminfo.src.html">terminfo database</a>.  This is mostly
due to terminals compatible with SCO UNIX, which was the successor of
Microsoft’s Xenix, which brought some semblance of the Microsoft DOS
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.kegel.com/nansi/">ANSI.SYS</a> driver capabilities.</p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="http://vt100.net/docs/vt510-rm/SGR">Select Graphics Rendition (SGR)</a>
on vt100 clones, which include many of the common sequences in <a class="reference external" href="http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-048.htm">ECMA-48</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Any sequence started by the <a class="reference external" href="http://invisible-island.net/xterm/ctlseqs/ctlseqs.html#h2-Controls-beginning-with-ESC">Control-Sequence-Inducer</a> is often
mistakenly termed as an “ANSI Escape Sequence” though not appearing in
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-048.htm">ECMA-48</a> or interpreted by the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.kegel.com/nansi/">ANSI.SYS</a> driver. The adjoining phrase
“Escape Sequence” is so termed because it follows the ASCII character
for the escape key (ESC, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">\x1b</span></code>).</p></li>
