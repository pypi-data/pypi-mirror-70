Description: # boiler-pytorch
        
        Basic framework for training stuff in PyTorch. It's quite tailored to projects 
        I've been working on lately, so it's meant for personal use. Its sole purpose is 
        to do away with *boiler*plate code, and having it here makes it easier to 
        share it across projects.
        
        ## Install
        
        ```shell script
        pip install boilr
        ```
        
        ## Usage example/template
        
        There's a usage example that can be useful as template. It's a basic VAE
        for MNIST quickly hacked together. The example files/folders are:
        - `example.py`
        - `models/`
        - `experiments/`
        
        Install requirements and run the example:
        
        ```shell script
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python example.py
        ```
        
        Last tested with:
        
        - `python 3.7.6`
        - `numpy 1.18.2`
        - `matplotlib 3.2.1`
        - `torch 1.4.0`
        - `torchvision 0.5.0`
        - `tensorboard 2.2.0` (it also works without, but it won't save tensorboard logs)
        - `pillow 7.1.1`
        - `tqdm 4.45.0`
