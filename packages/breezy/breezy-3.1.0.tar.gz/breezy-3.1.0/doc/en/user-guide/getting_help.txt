Getting help
============

Breezy comes with a built-in on-line help system, accessed through::

  brz help

You can ask for help on a command, or on non-command topics.  To see a
list of available help of each kind, use either::

  brz help commands
  brz help topics

For help on a particular command, use either of these forms::

  brz help status
  brz status --help

If you wish to search the help or read it as a larger document, the
information is also available in the Breezy User Reference.
