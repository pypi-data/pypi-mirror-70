    description="BaggingRandomMiner is an ensemble of weak one-class classifiers based on dissimilarities. In the training phase, every weak classifier is built using Bagging and computing a threshold of dissimilarities. In the classification phase, the classification scores of the weak classifiers are averaged, and every weak classifier computes its score based on the dissimilarity to the nearest neighbor and the threshold computed in the training phase.",
