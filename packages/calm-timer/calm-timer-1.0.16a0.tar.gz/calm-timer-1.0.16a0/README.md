## Installation

### Prerequisites

Make sure that Python 3.x is installed by typing `python --version` from the command line. (On Linux systems use `python3 --version`). The expected output looks something like this: `Python 3.8.2`. If Python 3.x has not been installed you will get an error similar to this: `Command not found`

If it's not installed you can download Python 3.x for your platform: https://www.python.org/downloads/

(By default i believe that Windows and MacOS doesn't have Python 3.x installed, but new Linux-based systems does have it)

### Using pip

For Win/Mac: On the command line: `pip install calm-timer`

For Linux-based systems: `sudo -H pip3 install calm-timer`

To run the application you can simply type `calm-timer` at the command line
