This project is a Python package meant to provide support for IsoTP (ISO-15765) protocol written in Python 3. The code is published under MIT license on GitHub (`pylessard/python-can-isotp <https://github.com/pylessard/python-can-isotp>`_).

This package contains a Python implementation of the protocol that works in the user space that may or may not be coupled with `python-can <https://python-can.readthedocs.io>`_.
