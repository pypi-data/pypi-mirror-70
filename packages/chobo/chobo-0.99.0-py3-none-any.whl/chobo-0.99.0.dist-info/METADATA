The chobo module is a forked version of the intrographics module developed by Dr. Lisa Torrey.
It allows you to create graphical displays in your Python 3 programs. The name chobo (초보) is a Korean word that means a beginner/novice, and the name is to inspire beginners at programming to give it a try.
It is written in Python 3, and uses the pygame module as the back-end
