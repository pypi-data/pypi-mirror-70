        # Unofficial Click UI 
        So, you have just designed a new command line app that works for you. 
        Now, you have a user base, who is not an IT/Software professional. 
        
        And you need an UI probably!
        
        And a Basic one would suffice?
        
        Then you can use this project/library to quickly create an UI with just 3 Lines of extra code.
        1. Add this project in your requirement.txt/setup.py
        1. Import the annotation
        1. Use the annotation
        
        This project is not promising you any fairytale UI framework. 
        It ONLY promises to be less obnoxious to non-IT non-Techinacal people.
        If you need something extravagant, you better design your own framework.
        
        Also, I never intend it to be part of any other framework.
        As I don't want make any other person to alter their way of working or coding because of this.
        
        ## Installation
        Currently this project is published in the pypi index.
        I wanted to publish it when it is stable. But seems like people will use it before it's stable.
        Simply install it using pip, or add it to your requirements.txt or setup.py
        ```bash
        pip install clickui-unofficial
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        ```python
        from clickui import make_ui # This one is from this framework
        import click 
        
        # Decorate your existing click command if you need an UI
        @make_ui 
        @click.command('Sample Command')
        def sample_command():
            pass
        ```
