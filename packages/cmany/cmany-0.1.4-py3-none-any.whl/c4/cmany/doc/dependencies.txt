Project dependencies
********************

Certain projects need to integrate their dependencies fully into their
build system, maybe because they are cross-platform or maybe because
certain compiler flags and macros need to be used not just in the
project's own source code, but also in the source code of the
project's dependencies. Or maybe because it's just more practical to
use CMake's external project facilities (which can serve as a sort-of
dependency manager, as illustrated by projects such as Hunter) to get
the dependencies' source code and compile them.

cmany offers the argument "--deps path/to/extern/CMakeLists.txt" to
enable building another CMake project which builds and installs the
dependencies of the current project. When "--deps" is given, the
external project is built for each configuration, and installed in the
configuration's build directory. Use "--deps-prefix" to specify a
different install directory for the external project.
