Documentation
-------------

Documentation will be available at [cmdkit.readthedocs.io](https://cmdkit.readthedocs.io).
Currently, development of additional features is a priority, but this is a great place for
contributing to the project.


Contributions
-------------

Contributions are welcome  in the form of  suggestions for additional features,  pull requests with
new features or  bug fixes, etc. If you find  bugs or have questions, open an  _Issue_ here. If and
when the project grows, a  code of conduct will be provided along side  a more comprehensive set of
guidelines for contributing; until then, just be nice.


Road Map
--------

- **additional unit tests**<br>
	Basic unit testing exists for the `Application`, `Interface` and `Daemon` classes. More comprehensive
	coverage of unit tests needs to be developed.

- **documentation and package management**<br>
	Comprehensive documentation of the API and a few recipes for using the library.
