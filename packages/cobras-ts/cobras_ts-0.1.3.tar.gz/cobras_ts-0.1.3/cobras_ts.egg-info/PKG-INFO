Description: ======================================
        Semi-supervised clustering with COBRAS
        ======================================
        
        Library for semi-supervised clustering using pairwise constraints.
        
        COBRAS supports three modes for constraint elicitation:
        
        1. With *labeled data*. in this case the pairwise relations are derived from the labels.
           This is mainly used to compare COBRAS experimentally to competitors.
        
        2. With *interaction through the commandline*.
           In this case the user is queried about the pairwise relations, and can answer with yes (y) and no (n)
           through the commandline. The indices that are shown in the queries are the row indices in the specified
           data matrix (starting from zero).
        
        3. With *interaction through a visual user interface*.
           If you use COBRAS-TS, the instantiation of COBRAS that is tailored to time series clustering, you can use an
           interactive web application that visualizes the data, queries, and intermediate clustering results. A demo can be
           found at https://dtai.cs.kuleuven.be/software/cobras/

        -----------------
        Installation
        -----------------
        
        This package is available on PyPi::
        
            $ pip install cobras_ts
        
        The following dependencies are automatically installed: dtaidistance, kshape, numpy, scikit-learn.
        
        In case you want to use the interactive GUI, install ``cobras_ts`` using the following command to
        automatically install additional dependencies (bokeh, datashader, and cloudpickle)::
        
            $ pip install pip cobras_ts[gui]
        
        If you want to additionally install tensorflow in order to cluster images::
        
            $ pip install pip cobras_ts[gui, images]
        
        -----------------
        Usage
        -----------------
        
        1. COBRAS from the command line
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        The COBRAS algorithm can easily be run from the command line.
        A ``cobras_ts`` script will be installed by pip::
        
            $ cobras_ts --format=csv --labelcol=0 /path/to/UCR_TS_Archive_2015/ECG200/ECG200_TEST
        
        This script is also available in the repository as ``cobras_ts_cli.py``.
        
        
        2. COBRAS as a Python package
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Examples of using COBRAS as a Python package can be found in the `examples` subdirectory.
        
        
        3. COBRAS in an jupyter notebook
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        An example on how to run COBRAS for time series clustering using a jupyter notebook can be found in examples/COBRAS_notebook_timeseries.ipynb.
        An example for image clustering can be found in examples/COBRAS_notebook_images.ipynb.
        In these examples, queries and results are plotted directly in the notebook and user feedback is given through the notebook prompt.
        
        
        4. COBRAS with a GUI
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        For instructions on using COBRAS with a GUI to cluster time series, see: https://dtai.cs.kuleuven.be/software/cobras/
        
        
        To run COBRAS on image data, add the --images option followed by the directory containing the images to be clustered.
        Note: this requires tensorflow to be installed. For example:
        
            $ cobras_ts --visual --images cobras_ts/webapp_images/data
        
        
        
        .. class:: no-web
        
            .. image:: ../../raw/master/images/cobras_images_resized.png
