==================================
collective.easyformplugin.poll
==================================

EasyForm plugin for conducting online polls, for anonymous and logged-in users.

Features
--------------

- Polls can be opened for anonymous users to vote
- If an open poll is allowed for anonymous but is inside a private folder, nobody can vote. Therefore the poll's parent folder needs to be published before opening the poll in order for this field to take effect
- Users can see partial results of the poll if necessary
- Results can be shown using a pie chart
- Polls can have relations with other content in the site

------------

Install collective.easyformplugin.poll by adding it to your buildout::

    [buildout]

    ...
