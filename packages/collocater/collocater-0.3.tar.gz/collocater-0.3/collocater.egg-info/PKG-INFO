Description: # Collocater 
        
        Collocater is a Python library for retrieving the collocations to be found in a message. The ontology it operates on has been scraped from the [Online OXFORD Collocation Dictionary](http://www.freecollocation.com/search?word=machine).
        
        Collocater can be added as a pipeline component to SpaCy's preprocessing pipeline, so that a messages' collocations can be retrireved the same way its named entities can.

        ## Installation
        
        ```bash
        pip install collocater --no-deps
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        ```python
        from collocater import collocater
        import spacy
        from pprint import pprint
        
        collie = collocater.Collocater.loader()
        nlp = spacy.load('en_core_web_sm')
        nlp.add_pipe(collie)
        
        text = "If this isn't a bunch of beautiful flowers I don't know what is!"
        doc = nlp(text)
        print(doc._.collocs) # returns [bunch of, bunch of beautiful flowers, beautiful flowers]
        
        #Tokens with associated collocations in text:
        colls = [(col.text, col.start_char, col.end_char, col.label_) for col in doc._.collocs]
        pprint(colls) # returns [
        #                          ('bunch of', 16, 24, 'bunch_noun__prep'),
        #                          ('bunch of beautiful flowers', 16, 42, 'flower_noun__quant'),
        #                          ('beautiful flowers', 25, 42, 'flower_noun__adj')
        #                          ]
        
        print(collie(text))
        #{'beautiful flowers': {'coll_type': 'flower_noun__adj', 'location': [7, 9]},
        # 'bunch of': {'coll_type': 'bunch_noun__prep', 'location': [5, 7]},
        # 'bunch of beautiful flowers': {'coll_type': 'flower_noun__quant',
        #                                'location': [5, 9]}}
        ```
