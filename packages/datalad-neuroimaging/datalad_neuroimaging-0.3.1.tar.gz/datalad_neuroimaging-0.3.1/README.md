This extension enhances DataLad (http://datalad.org) for working with
neuroimaging data and workflows. Please see the [extension
documentation](http://datalad-neuroimaging.rtfd.org)
for a description on additional commands and functionality.

For general information on how to use or contribute to DataLad (and this
extension), please see the [DataLad website](http://datalad.org) or the
[main GitHub project page](http://datalad.org).


## Installation

Before you install this package, please make sure that you [install a recent
version of git-annex](https://git-annex.branchable.com/install).  Afterwards,
install the latest version of `datalad-neuroimaging` from
[PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/datalad-neuroimaging). It is recommended to use
a dedicated [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io):

    # create and enter a new virtual environment (optional)
    virtualenv --system-site-packages --python=python3 ~/env/dataladni
    . ~/env/dataladni/bin/activate

    # install from PyPi
    pip install datalad_neuroimaging

There is also a [Singularity container](http://singularity.lbl.gov) available.
The latest release version can be obtained by running:

    singularity pull shub://datalad/datalad-neuroimaging
