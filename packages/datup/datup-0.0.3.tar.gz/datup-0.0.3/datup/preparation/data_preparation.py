def col_cast(
    df,

):
    r'''
    Return a dataframe with a set of columns casted.

    Parameters
    ----------
    df : DataFrame
        It is the DataFrame with which want to work
    columns : list, default None
        A list of columns which want to cast
    to_cast : str, default None
        The type of cast as str, int, float, etc.

    :return: A DataFrame with columns casted
    :rtype: DataFrame

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import datup as dt

    Parameters
    ----------
    df : DataFrame
        It is the DataFrame with which want to work
    method : str, default 'spearman'
        Took it from Pandas corr methods description
        Method of correlation:
            pearson : standard correlation coefficient
            kendall : Kendall Tau correlation coefficient
            spearman : Spearman rank correlation
            callable: callable with input two 1d ndarrays 
                and returning a float. Note that the returned matrix from corr will have 1 along the diagonals
                and will be symmetric regardless of the callableâ€™s behavior.
    threshold : float, default 0.7
        Is the threshold of correlation factor which goes from 0 to 1

    :return: A Graph with correlation factors between features
    :rtype: Graph
    :return: A list with features that doesn't contribute with additional information to drop
    :rtype: List
