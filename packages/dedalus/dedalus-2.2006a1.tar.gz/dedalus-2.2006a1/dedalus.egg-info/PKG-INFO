        ## About Dedalus
        
        Dedalus is a flexible framework for solving partial differential equations using spectral methods.
        The code is open-source and developed by a team of researchers working on problems in astrophysical and geophysical fluid dynamics.
        
        The code is written primarily in Python and features an easy-to-use interface, including text-based equation entry.
        Our numerical algorithm produces highly sparse systems for a wide variety of equations on spectrally-discretized domains.
        These systems are efficiently solved using compiled libraries and multidimensional parallelization though MPI.
