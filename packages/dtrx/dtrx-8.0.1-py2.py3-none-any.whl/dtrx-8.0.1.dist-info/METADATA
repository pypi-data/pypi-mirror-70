# dtrx

"**Do The Right eXtraction**" - don't remember what set of `tar` flags or where to
pipe the output to extract it? no worries!

TL;DR

```bash
pip install dtrx

dtrx yolo.tar.gz
```

This is a copy-paste of the original dtrx repo, and **all credit for this
software** should be attributed to the original author, Brett Smith @brettcs:

See the original [`README`](README) for more details on what this does!

## Changes in this repo

This repo contains some patches on top of the original source to enable using
`dtrx` with python3. The original motivation was to enable `dtrx` on Ubuntu
20.04+, where the `dtrx` apt package was removed from the default ppas (likely
due to being python2 only).

I attempted to get the tests all working via `tox` , for which I used a
Dockerfile to try to get some kind of environment consistency. You can run the
tests by running (requires Docker installed):

```bash
./test.sh
```

## TODO

### Python 3.9

Now that python 3.9 has entered the RC stage, we should include a target
classifier and support 3.9 in the test suite!
