4. Calculate variance of Stokes and anti-Stokes measurements
============================================================

The goal of this notebook is to estimate the variance of the noise of
the Stokes measurement. The measured Stokes and anti-Stokes signals
contain noise that is distributed approximately normal. We need to
estimate the variance of the noise to: - Perform a weighted calibration
- Construct confidence intervals

.. code:: ipython3

    import os
    
    from dtscalibration import read_silixa_files
    from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
    
    %matplotlib inline


.. parsed-literal::

    /Users/bfdestombe/anaconda3/envs/dts/lib/python3.7/typing.py:847: FutureWarning: xarray subclass DataStore should explicitly define __slots__
      super().__init_subclass__(*args, **kwargs)


.. code:: ipython3

    filepath = os.path.join('..', '..', 'tests', 'data', 'double_ended2')
    
    ds = read_silixa_files(
        directory=filepath,
        timezone_netcdf='UTC',
        file_ext='*.xml')


.. parsed-literal::

    6 files were found, each representing a single timestep
    6 recorded vars were found: LAF, ST, AST, REV-ST, REV-AST, TMP
    Recorded at 1693 points along the cable
    The measurement is double ended
    Reading the data from disk


And we define the sections as we learned from the previous notebook.
Sections are required to calculate the variance in the Stokes.

.. code:: ipython3

    sections = {
        'probe1Temperature': [slice(7.5, 17.), slice(70., 80.)],  # cold bath
        'probe2Temperature': [slice(24., 34.), slice(85., 95.)],  # warm bath
        }
    ds.sections = sections

Lets first read the documentation about the ``ds.variance_stokes``
method.

.. code:: ipython3

    print(ds.variance_stokes.__doc__) 


.. parsed-literal::

    Backwards compatibility. See `ds.variance_stokes_constant()`
            


.. code:: ipython3

    I_var, residuals = ds.variance_stokes(st_label='st')
    print("The variance of the Stokes signal along the reference sections "
          "is approximately {} on a {} sec acquisition time".format(I_var, ds.userAcquisitionTimeFW.data[0]))


.. parsed-literal::

    The variance of the Stokes signal along the reference sections is approximately 8.181920419777416 on a 2.0 sec acquisition time


.. code:: ipython3

    from dtscalibration import plot
    
    fig_handle = plot.plot_residuals_reference_sections(
            residuals,
            sections,
            title='Distribution of the noise in the Stokes signal',
            plot_avg_std=I_var ** 0.5,
            plot_names=True,
            robust=True,
            units='',
            method='single')

The residuals should be normally distributed and independent from
previous time steps and other points along the cable. If you observe
patterns in the residuals plot (above), it might be caused by: - The
temperature in the calibration bath is not uniform - Attenuation caused
by coils/sharp bends in cable - Attenuation caused by a splice

.. code:: ipython3

    import scipy
    import numpy as np
    
    sigma = residuals.std()
    mean = residuals.mean()
    x = np.linspace(mean - 3*sigma, mean + 3*sigma, 100)
    approximated_normal_fit = scipy.stats.norm.pdf(x, mean, sigma)
    residuals.plot.hist(bins=50, figsize=(12, 8), density=True)
    plt.plot(x, approximated_normal_fit);

We can follow the same steps to calculate the variance from the noise in
the anti-Stokes measurments by setting ``st_label='AST`` and redo the
steps.
