Extinguish or Unextinguish Data
###############################

Two of the three flavors of models include a function to calculate the
factor to multiple (extinguish) or divide (unextinguish) a spectrum by
to add or remove the effects of dust, respectively.

Extinguish is also often called reddening.  Extinguishing a spectrum often
reddens the flux, but sometimes 'bluens' the flux
(e.g, on the short wavelength side of the 2175 A bump).
So extinguish is the more generic term.

Notebooks
=========

A great way to show how to use the `dust_extinction` package is using a
jupyter notebook.  Check out the
`Analyzing interstellar reddening and calculating synthetic photometry
<http://learn.astropy.org/rst-tutorials/color-excess.html>`_
notebook that was created as part of the
`Learn.Astropy
<http://learn.astropy.org/>`_ effort.
