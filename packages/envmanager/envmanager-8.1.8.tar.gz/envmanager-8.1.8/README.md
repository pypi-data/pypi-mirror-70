# Welcome to Envmanager for Python Docs

Envmanager is a reliable tool to validate and parse environment variables by providing a typing schema, in the most efficient way.

:white_check_mark: Validate and parse (or cast) your environment variables on the fly           

:white_check_mark: Scope variables to the right environment (Prod, Dev, Staging, ...) all in one place.
               
:white_check_mark: Ensure no collisions between separate environment variable files
     

Here is how you would use this library:

1 - Define your schema as an enum or dictionary.    
2 - Load and validate *.cfg files using the loader function or decorator.   
3 - Reliably retrieve the expected object type upon retrieval.  

 >&#x1F534; **TLDR: Scroll to the bottom of the page for a full working examples**

To give you a quick overview before diving deeper, here is how your code may look like:

**Your env variables as cfg files**

_my_env.cfg_
```
[common]
an_int_value = 10
email = bytectgroup@gmail.com
custom_key = this_will_be_validated_by_me
```
...

1 - Config Stage:

_schema_definition.py_
```python
from marshmallow import fields

# Define Schema
schema = { 
    "an_int_value": int, # use builtin types like str, int, float to parse the variables
    "email": fields.Email(),  # use full power of Marshmallow validator to parse your environment varialbes
    "custom_key": MyCustomValidator(),  # you can pass your own validator object to validate and parse custom environment variables!
}

...

# Configure

from envmanager import EnvManagerConfig

envloader_config = EnvManagerConfig( 
    env_paths=['path/to/my_env_file.cfg'], 
    schema=schema,  # optional
    eager_validate=True  # validate the env variables based on the schema upon assigning them as environment variables 
)
```

2 - Loading/Validation Stage

_main.py_
```python
from envmanager.decorators import env_loader

@env_loader(envloader_config)  # saves all cfg file content onto the os.environ
def app_entry_point():
    from my_project import App  # ENSURE you do not import env-variable dependent code prior to envl_loader being called
    App.start()
```

3 - Retrieval/Parsing stage

_my_project.py_
```python
from envmanager import Env
env = Env(envloader_config)  # pass the same envloader config object to Env class

def my_function():
    env('an_int_value')  # returns integer
    env('custom_key')  # returns custom validator/parser validate method's return value
    env('email')  # returns valid email
```


## Documentation    

### Guidelines



* Envmanager does stuff behind the scene to set and get environment variables. All keys will be prepended by uppercase
value of each group as specified in configuration (i.e. EnvManagerConfig object) to ensure no collision between identical
keys in two different groups.

### Environment Variable Files
> IMPORTANT NOTE: You must provide your environment variables inside a cfg file. No other file extension is supported at this point. Read more on cfg file format [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/configparser.html). 


#### Sections:
Envmanager is created with scalability in mind. It is often the case that your environment variables are dependent on which environment your application is being run from (e.g. prod vs dev) while some variables are common.
The way Envmanager works is that it **takes exactly two sections per config file**: one **"common"** and one **"environment dependent"**.


#### Mode

The mode, which tells the envmanager which section (in addition to the common section) is to be read, is denoted by the key named "environment_mode".

* Defining the mode in-file style:

    If this value is missing, simply the common section values will be read and maybe validated/parsed (if schema is provided).
    
    ![img](assets/screenshot_modes_section.png)
    
    Notice how the mode is named after the available section in the file. Changing the value of the "environment_mode" to "dev" will result in the section named "dev" be loaded and parsed. Hence the value of the variable "value" would be equal to "dev" during run-time. Note that any other section than these two will be COMPLETELY ignored by the loader.
    
    - Note#1
        
    > You are NOT obligated to specify mode or any other section than the one you want. Either ensure the section name is set to "**common**" or specify the name using "**common_section_identifier**" argument of the configuration.
   
    - Note#2
    > In case you wish to denote this key by a different value, you need to override the default value via "**environment_identifier_key**" argument of the configuration. Read more about the EnvManagerConfig in the documentation below.
    
* Defining the the environment mode during configuration:
    
    In case of loading multiple *.cfg files (e.g. env_paths argument is an array of more than a single path) you may want to
    specify the environment one time only, since a mismatch may cause some nasty runtime complications (e.g. db.cfg file is on "dev" mode, while app.cfg file is on "prod" mode). In that case, simply set the "**environment_mode**" argument of the configuration class constructor. Doing so will result in automatically **ignoring** the in-file style mode specifications (even if they are defined already):
    ```python
    from envmanager import EnvManagerConfig
    from MyConstants import ENVIRONMENT_MODE
    
    config = EnvManagerConfig(
          ...,
          environment_mode=ENVIRONMENT_MODE  # this one overrides the modes defined in all files
      )
    ```
 
## EnvManagerConfig Class
EnvManagerConfig provides all that is needed for envmanager to function properly. Based on the capacity at which you
wish to use Envmanager, you can configure Envmanager via EnvManagerConfig in the following two ways:

* You have one or more configuration files to manage, and you do not care about name collisions:

_config.py_
```python
config =  EnvManagerConfig(
    group_name='TESTERAPP',  # Optional. Defaults to PYTHON_APPLICATION
    env_paths=[MY_ENV_FILE_PATH_1, MY_ENV_FILE_PATH_2, ...],  # multiple (or single) file(s)
    schema=MySchema,  # Optional. enum or dictionary as per the documentation
    eager_validate=True  # Validates during the loading time (typically at the beginning of your application) 
)
```

* You have multiple configuration files and you want to ensure no collision:

_config.py_
```python
config = EnvManagerConfig.by_group({
    'GROUP1': {
        'env_paths': [MY_ENV_FILE_1],  # all content will be saved under group 1
        'schema': GroupOneSchema  # enum or dictionary as per the documentation
    },
    'GROUP2': {
        'env_paths': [MY_ENV_FILE_2, MY_ENV_FILE_3],  # all content will be saved under group 2
        'schema': GroupTwoSchema,  # enum or dictionary as per the documentation
    }
})
```

Class constructor signature:
```python
    def __init__(
        self, 
        env_paths,
        group_name="PYTHON_APPLICATION",
        eager_validate=False,
        environment_mode=None,
        schema=None,
        common_section_identifier='common',
        environment_identifier_key='environment_mode',
    ):
    ...
```

_**env_paths**_: list

   * List. Contains all the *.cfg files you wish to parse

_**group_name**_: str *default = PYTHON_APPLICATION*

   * Optional. All the env-variables will be prepended by this value.
    
_**eager_validate**_:boolean *default = False*

   * Validates env-variables according to the schema (if provided). Also checks for missing parameters. Defaults to False, in which case the values will be saved without question, and if corrupted, you may get unexpected results upon casting or parsing the value at retreival-time.


_**environment_mode**_:str *default = None*

   * In-configuration style of specifying application environment (e.g. PROD, DEV, LOCAL). Overrides in-file mode specifications.


_**schema**_:Union[dict, Enum] *default = None*

   * Schema corresponding to the env-variable files whose paths are provided. The keys on the schema must match the 
   variable names in the cfg files exactly. 
   
   * Enum as a schema:
    An enum has a key and a value (i.e. my_key = validator) and is a great candidate for a Schema since it can be used for both validation/parsing (MySchema.my_key.value) and value retrieval (MySchema.my_key).
```python
from enum import Enum
 
class MySchema(Enum):
    an_int_value = fields.Int()  # DO NOT use builtin types (e.g. int, str) as the key/value pairs must be unique references in an Enum class
    email = fields.Email()
    custom_key = MyCustomValidator()  # implements validate(self, value: str) method. Returns parsed value

...

env(MySchema.an_int_value)  # returns an int
env(MySchema.email)  # returns validated email as string
env(MySchema.custom_key)  # returns your validator class' validate method return value
```

   * Dictionary as a schema:
        A dictionary can be used to describe the schema. In a dictionary, unlike an Enum, you are allowed to use primitive types such as int, float, str etc.
```python
schema = { 
    "an_int_value": int, # use can builtin types like str, int, float to parse the variables, if you wish
    "email": fields.Email(),  # use full power of Marshmallow validator to parse your environment varialbes
    "custom_key": MyCustomValidator(),  # you can pass your own validator object to validate and parse custom environment variables!
}

...

env('an_int_value')  # returns an int
env('email')  # returns validated email as string
env('custom_key')  # returns your validator class' validate method return value
```
   * Schemas may _partially_ capture the loaded environment variables or be absent from the configuration altogether (i.e. no validation/parsing).: 
  
```python
env(MyEnumSchema.my_variable)  # schema defined

env('schema_less_variable')  # schema-less variable
```

_**common_section_identifier**_:str *default = 'common'*

   * The section name in the cfg file that contains values that are 'common' between environments (e.g. PROD, DEV, LOCAL etc.).

*my_env_vars.cfg*
```
[common] <------------------- common_section_identifier (name must match)
environment_mode = prod <---- environment_identifier_key with value 'prod'
... <------------------------ all common values are loaded

[prod] <--------------------- prod section is loaded
....

[local] <-------------------- whole section is ignored
... 
```

_**environment_identifier_key**_:str *default = 'environment_mode'*

   * The key that will be used to specify the mode for in-file style environment mode specification. Must reside in the "common" section. If key is missed, the corresponding environment's section variable will NOT be loaded (so only the common section will).

*my_env_vars.cfg*
```
[common] <------------------- common_section_identifier
environment_mode = prod <---- environment_identifier_key with value 'prod'
an_int_value = 10

[prod] <--------------------- prod section is read
host=production-host

[local] <-------------------- whole section ignored
host=localhost 
```

Class method "by_group" signature:
```python
@staticmethod
def by_group(
    dict_object: dict,
    environment_mode=None
):
        ...
```
_**dict_object**_
    
   * Has the following shape:  
    
``` python

    {
        'GROUP1': {
            'env_paths': [MY_ENV_FILE_1],  # Mandatory. All content will be saved under group 1
            'schema': GroupOneSchema,  # Optional. Enum or dictionary as per the documentation
            'common_section_identifier': 'my_common_section_name',  # Optional. Defaults to "common".
            'environment_identifier_key': 'my_environment_identifier_key',  # Optional. Defaults to "environment_mode"
            'eager_validate': True  # Optional. Defaults to True
        },
        'GROUP2': {
            'env_paths': [MY_ENV_FILE_2, MY_ENV_FILE_3],  # Mandatory. All content will be saved under group 2
            'schema': GroupTwoSchema,  # Optional. Enum or dictionary as per the documentation
            ... # so on
        }
    }
```

_**environment_mode**_:str *default = None*

   * In-configuration style of specifying application environment (e.g. PROD, DEV, LOCAL). Overrides in-file mode specifications. This means if the mode is specified here, the parser will look for a section named after the mode in every file and if such mode exits, the values of that section will be loaded and associated with the specified group.

## Loading the Env Variables
This usually happens at the point of entry of your application since one may need to access environment variables at any point within the app.

There are two options when it comes to loading your environment variables: use a decorator or simply call the loader funtion:

### Using the Decorator:
_main.py_
```python
from envmanager.decorators import env_loader
from envmanager import EnvManagerConfig

config = EnvManagerConfig(...) 

@env_loader(config)  # run prior to all other imports - saves all cfg file content onto the os.environ
def app_entry_point():
    from my_project import App  # ENSURE you do not import env-variable dependent code prior to envl_loader being called
    App.start()
```

### Using the function:
_main.py_
```python
from envmanager import load_env, EnvManagerConfig

config = EnvManagerConfig(...) 

def my_function():
    load_env(config)  # run prior to all other imports - saves all cfg file content onto the os.environ
    from my_project import App  # ENSURE you do not import env-variable dependent code prior to envl_loader being called
    App.start()
```


### Env Class
You can access environment variables using an env object. Construct your Env class object by passing to the constructor the **same** config object used to load the env-variables earlier.

```python
from envmanager import Env
 
env = Env(config)  # import config from your codebase
```

#### Getting a variable:
There are multiple ways to get an environment variable. If you have provided a schema to the configuration, you simply call
the env object itself and pass the key:
```python
my_int = env(MyEnumSchema.my_int_env_variable)  # schema provided is an Enum class object
```
```python
my_int = env('my_int_env_variable')  # use string value matching the variable name if schema is not provided or is a dictionary
```
* Casting:  
You may cast (the otherwise stringified) environment variable using env casting methods:
```python
my_int = env.int('my_schemaless_int_env_variable')
``` 

> Note that using the casting methods will **override** the schema if used on keys whose schema are already defined.

Here is the list of available casting methods:
* _**str(self, key)**_
* _**int(self, key)**_
* _**bool(self, key)**_
* _**float(self, key)**_
* _**dict(self, key)**_:
    
    parses the target environment variable as a dictionary using json.loads function

* _**decimal(self, key, context=None)**_

    parses the target environment variable as a Decimal object.

* _**list(self, key)**_:
    
    parses the target environment variable as a string
    
* _**json(self, key, \*\*loads_kwargs)**_:
    
    parses the target environment variable as a json using json.loads and then json.dumps functions

* _**datetime(self, key, date_format='%m/%d/%y %H:%M:%S')**_:
    parses the target environment variable as a datetime object:
            datetime_str = '09/19/18 13:55:26'
            datetime_object = datetime.strptime(datetime_str, '%m/%d/%y %H:%M:%S')
    
* _**date(self, key, date_format='%m-%d-%Y')**_:
    
    parses the target environment variable as a date object:
            date_str = '09-19-2018'
            date_object = datetime.strptime(date_str, '%m-%d-%Y').date()
            
* _**timedelta_sec(self, key)**_:

    parses the target environment variable as a timedelta in seconds
    
* _**url(self, key)**_:
    
    parses the target environment variable as a url object
        constructs a url object using the urlparse method from urllib library.
    
* _**uuid(self, key, \*args, \*\*kwargs)**_: 
    
   constructs a new UUID instance, kwargs also passed to the constructor if any.
    
* _**log_level_as_int(self, key)**_:
 
    converts the target environment variable to a valid log level as an integer using logging.getLevelName function: value DEBUG results in integer value 10

* _**log_level_as_str(self, key)**_: 

    converts the target environment variable to a valid log level string value using logging.getLevelName function: value 10 results in string value DEBUG
* _**custom_parse(self, key, parser_function: Callable)**_: 
    
    You can pass your own parser function that takes exactly 1 argument with no defaults

#### Setting a new variable:
You can use the env object to also set an evnironment variable. The variable will be saved as a string. It is up to you 
to use the casting methods to ensure the correct type when getting the variable back:

```python
env.set('new_variable', [1,2,3])
...
env('new_variable') == '[1,2,3]'  # returns true 
env.list('new_variable') == [1,2,3]  # casted first -> returns true 
```

#### Deleting a variable
```python
env.clear('my_env_variable_1')  # no schema or dict schema, use plain string
...
env.clear(MySchemaEnum.my_env_variable_2)  # enum schema can be used to clear a variable much like retrieving one
```

#### Managing groups and prepended variables:
You can use env in a context to get variables from different groups and also use contexts in the same way to access all variables prepended by a certain word!

* Groupings
```python
with env.group('GROUP2'):   # capture group
    res = env('duplicate_variable') 
    assert res == 'GROUP2_VALUE'  # Pass

with env.group('GROUP1'):
    res = env('duplicate_variable')
    assert res == 'GROUP1_VALUE' # Pass
```

* Prepended words

You may want to reduce redundancy by using contexts in case you have a large configuration file with a lot of groupings already done through namings such as the following case: 
        
```
DB_VAR_HOST
DB_VAR_PORT 
DB_VAR_USERNAME

DB_REMOTE_HOST
DB_REMOTE_PORT
...
```

In this case you can use the *prepend* function in a context like so:              
```python
    with env.group('GROUP1'):
        with env.prepend('DB'):  # you can nest contexts to capture a specific group!
            with env.prepend('VAR'):
                env('HOST')  # DB_VAR_HOST
            with env.prepend('REMOTE'):  # still inside prepend('DB') context
                env('HOST') # DB_REMOTE_HOST
```

### The (Custom) Validator Class
You can create your own validator class. You must however ensure that your class implements function with the signature: *validate(self, value)* and **returns** the parsed value after validation.

```python

from envmanager import Validator  # the interface

class MyValidator(Validator):
    ...
    def validate(self, v):
        ... # validate v
        return parsed_value
```

## Recommended Usage Patterns

* Single Schema, One or More *.cfg Files (Collisions may happen):

## Issues
Please create an issue [here](https://github.com/arianseyedi/python-envmanager/issues). Please provide a brief
explanation and, if necessary, provide a snippet for reproducibility sake.

Cheers!

## Development
#### The First Timer:
* Once cloned, create a virtual environment using:
```
virtualenv -p python3 venv
```
then 
```shell script
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

create a new feature branch from develop, commit and submit a PR. It'll be much appreciated!

### Dependencies and special thanks!
This project heavily depends on the great work of other awesome developers of the open source world!
- [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/) by [anatoly](https://pypi.org/user/anatoly/)
- [marshmallow](https://marshmallow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/quickstart.html#validation)

I was deeply inspired by [environs](https://pypi.org/project/environs/) package which I referenced for cool usage patterns.

Enjoy!
