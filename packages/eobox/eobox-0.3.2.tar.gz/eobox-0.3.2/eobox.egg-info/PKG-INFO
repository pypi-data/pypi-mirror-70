        **eobox** is a Python package with a small collection of tools for working with Remote Sensing / Earth Observation data. 
        
        
        ## Package Overview
        
        So far, the following subpackages are available:
        
        * **eobox.sampledata** contains small sample data that can be used for playing around and testing.
        
        * **eobox.raster** contains raster processing tools for
        
            * extracting raster values at given (by vector data) locations,
        
            * window- / chunk-wise processing of multiple single layer raster 
              files that do not fit in memory, e.g.
        
              * calculating virtual time series and temporal statistical 
                metrics from all cloud-free observations,
              
              * predicting a machine learning model,
        
              * custom processing functions.
        
        * **eobox.vector** contains vector processing tools for
        
            * clean convertion of polygons to lines and 
        
            * distance-to-polygon border calculation.
        
        * **eobox.ml** contains machine learning related tools, e.g.
        
            * plotting a confusion matrix including with precision and recall
        
            * extended predict function which returns prediction, confidences, and probabilities.  
        
        
        ## Installation
        
        The package requires Python 3. It can be installed with the following command:
        
        ```bash
        pip install eobox
        ```
        
        The *environment.yaml* in the repository can be used to setup a conda environment with all dependencies required for using and building the package and running the tests and documentation code.
        
        ```bash
        conda env create --name=eobox --file=environment.yml
        pip install eobox
        ```
        
        ## Documentation
        
        The package documentation can be found at [readthedocs](https://eo-box.readthedocs.io/).
