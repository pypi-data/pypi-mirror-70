Description: ### Python cffi bridge to fontconfig's FcFontList/FcFontMatch
        
        Note: this is [a plublished](https://pypi.org/project/fclist-cffi/) fork of tarruda [`python-fclist`](https://github.com/tarruda/python-fclist).
        
        Useful for python programs that need to query information about fonts installed in the system(use this instead of parsing fc-list output).
        Requires the fontconfig shared library installed in a directory that the [cffi module] can find.
        
        ### Installing
        
        ```sh
        pip install fclist-cffi
        ```
        
        ### Usage
        
        ```python
        from fclist import fclist, fcmatch
        
        # Print the family, style and file path of monospace/truetype fonts
        for font in fclist(spacing='mono', fontformat='TrueType'):
            print font.family, font.style, font.file
        
        # Print the system's default monospace font
        print fcmatch('monospace')
        ```
        
        `fclist` can receive any keyword arguments that can be passed to the `fc-list`
        command, and the returned font objects have most attributes defined by
        fontconfig.h.
        
        `fcmatch` receives the same pattern that is normally passed to `fc-match`, but
        it doesn't support the --all/--sort options(only returns a single font object).
        
        ### Tests
        
        Tests are written to use [pytest].
