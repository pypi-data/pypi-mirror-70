        Flatland is a open-source toolkit for developing and comparing Multi Agent Reinforcement Learning algorithms in little (or ridiculously large!) gridworlds.
        
        The base environment is a two-dimensional grid in which many agents can be placed, and each agent must solve one or more navigational tasks in the grid world. 
        
        [The official documentation](http://flatland.aicrowd.com/) contains full details about the environment and problem statement

        üì¶ Setup
        ---
        
        ### Prerequisites
        
        * Install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/)
        * Create a new conda environment:
        
        ```console
        $ conda create python=3.6 --name flatland-rl
        $ conda activate flatland-rl
        ```
        
        * Install the necessary dependencies:
        
        ```console
        $ conda install -c conda-forge cairosvg pycairo
        $ conda install -c anaconda tk  
        ```
        
        ### Stable Release
        
        You can install Flatland from pip:
        
        ```console
        $ pip install flatland-rl
        ```
        
        This is the preferred method to install Flatland, as it will always install the most recent stable release.
        
        ### From sources
        
        The Flatland code source is available from [AIcrowd gitlab](https://gitlab.aicrowd.com/flatland/flatland).
        
        You can clone the public repository:
        ```console
        $ git clone git@gitlab.aicrowd.com:flatland/flatland.git
        ```
        
        Once you have a copy of the source, you can install it with:
        
        ```console
        $ python setup.py install
        ```
        
        ### Test installation
        
        Test that the installation works:
        
        ```console
        $ flatland-demo
        ```
        
        You can also run the full test suite:
        
        ```console
        python setup.py test
        ```
