# folder_cleaner
 A Python script that lets you organize and clean your folders quickly and easily!

 ### Installation
 - Download or clone this repository
 - Unzip if needed
 - You can now directly open `folder_cleaner.py` and start organizing your folders!

> (On macOS you have a special script to open it `Open Folder Cleaner on macOS` because you can't just double click it (it could prompt you to a script editor) )

 ### Dependencies
 - Python 3 (downloadable at https://www.python.org/downloads/)
 - LifeEasy
 - FileCenter

 > Both LifeEasy and FileCenter are libraries written by me and will be installed automatically at first launch.

 > This program shows one way of using my libraries.

 ### Platform/Working OS
 - This python script is cross-platform and has been tested on macOS and Windows.

 ### Usage
 Folder Cleaner (for Python) usage is very simple.

 - Open the file (with Python) and you will be prompted to enter the path of the folder you want to review (tips: you can also simply drag and drop the folder into the terminal).
 - Type the desired organizing mode and press `enter` to continue.
 - The program will do everything else automatically!

 ### Available organizing mode
- `nosort` > nothing will be sorted in the cleaned up folder.
- `type`   > each file will be sorted and put in a folder according to its type.

### Issues
