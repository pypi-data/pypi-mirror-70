        .. contents:: Table of Contents
        
        ``ftw.events`` is a Plone add-on allowing you to add containers (event folders)
        containing items representing an event (event page). It is backed by
        ``plone.app.event`` and is powered by ``ftw.simplelayout``.
        
        This Plone add-on is compatible with Plone 4.3.x
        
        
        Installation
        ************
        
        - Add the package to your buildout configuration:
        
        ::
        
            [instance]
            eggs +=
                ...
                ftw.events
        
        - Install the "default" GenericSetup profile.
        
        
        Usage
        *****
        
        Start by creating a container which will hold the events by adding a *event folder*.
        Add as many *event pages* to the event folder as you like.
        
        
        Mopage Support
        ==============
        
        ``ftw.events`` provides integration for the mopage mobile app
        (http://web.anthrazit.org/).
        
        
        Data Endpoint
        -------------
        
        The view ``mopage.events.xml`` returns an XML-feed with the latest events within
        the context it is called. It can becalled on any type of object.
        
        - The mopage-API expects a ``partnerid`` and a ``importid``.
          They are incldued when submitted via GET-parameter, e.g.:
          ``http://foo.com/events/mopage.events.xml?partnerid=123&importid=456``
        
        - The endpoint returns only 100 events by default.
          This can be changed with the parameter ``?per_page=200``.
        
        - The endpoint returns ``Link``-headers in the response with pagination links.
        
        
        Trigger behavior
        ----------------
        
        The behavior ``ftw.events.behaviors.mopage.IPublisherMopageTrigger`` can be added
        on a event folder in order to configure automatic notification to the mopage API
        that new events are published.
        
        In order for the behavior to work properly you need an ``ftw.publisher`` setup.
        Only the receiver-side (public website) will trigger the notification.
        A configured ``collective.taskqueue`` is required for this to work.
        
        Buildout example:
        
        .. code:: ini
        
            [instance]
            eggs +=
                ftw.events[mopage_publisher_receiver]
        
            zope-conf-additional +=
                %import collective.taskqueue
                <taskqueue />
                <taskqueue-server />
        
        
        Then enable the behavior for the event folder type and configure the trigger
        with the newly availabe fields.
        
        
        Background
        **********
        
        The name of the content type *event page* has been chosen in order to avoid confusion
        with the content type *event* of Plone.
