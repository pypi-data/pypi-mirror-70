GeospatIal Distribution DYnamics (giddy) in PySAL
=================================================

Giddy is an open-source python library for the analysis of dynamics of
longitudinal spatial data. Originating from the spatial dynamics module
in PySAL (Python Spatial Analysis Library), it is under active development
for the inclusion of many newly proposed analytics that consider the
role of space in the evolution of distributions over time and has
several new features including inter- and intra-regional decomposition
of mobility association and local measures of exchange mobility in
addition to space-time LISA and spatial markov methods.
