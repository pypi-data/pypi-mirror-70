    'long_description': "# GIT PR branch\n\n`git-pr-branch` is a command line tool designed to manage the relationship between branches and\npull-requests.\n\nAt the moment it only supports Github, but other backends are possible.\n\nYou need to create a personal token in https://github.com/settings/tokens. When you start the\nprogram for the first time, it will ask you for it and store it in a configuration file.\n\nI suggest running `git config alias.pr '!git-pr-branch'` to simplify git integration. You will just\nneed to type `git pr` to run `git-pr-branch`, options and arguments will be forwarded. With this\nalias, you can replace `git-pr-branch` with just `git pr` in the following examples.\n\n## Checking out pull requests\n\n`git-pr-branch checkout 42` will a pull request #42 in a local branch, creating a new branch each\ntime the command is run. Why, you ask? Because it is common for PR authors to amend their commits\nafter a review instead of adding more commits, and as a reviewer it's hard to see the differences\nbetween the code you reviewed and the new code. By creating a new branch each time, you can just\ndiff with the previous branch.\n\nIf you have not checked out this PR before, it will create a branch for every existing review in the\nPR's history. This way it'll be easy to see what's changed between earlier reviews even if you did\nnot run the command at that time.\n\n## Displaying branches and pull requests\n\n`git-pr-branch show` will list all your local branches and show you whether they are associated with\na pull request, whether that PR is still open or not, and the URL for that PR.\n\n## Purging branches\n\n`git-pr-branch purge` will delete the branches that are linked to a closed pull request (or multiple\npull requests that are all closed). This will let you keep your local repo tidy.\n",
