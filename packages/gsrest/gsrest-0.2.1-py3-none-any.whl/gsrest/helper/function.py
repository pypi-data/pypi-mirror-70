# I tried to create delegated properties dynamically like this:
#
#     for sub in some_subattributes:
#         setattr(cls, sub, property(
#             lambda obj: getattr(obj.attr, sub),
#             lambda obj, value: setattr(obj.attr, sub, value)
#             ))
#
# but there is bug in this snippet. The lambda function closes the variable
# 'sub' lexically, so just gets evaluated when the lambda function is called.
# So that, only the last loop value of 'sub' is applied to every lambda call.
#
# The solution comes taking the variable out of the lambda.
# See https://stackoverflow.com/a/2295368
#
# A working snippets using double lambda would look like this:
#
#     for sub in some_subattributes:
#         setattr(cls, sub, property(
#             (lambda x: lambda obj: getattr(self.attr, x))(sub),
#             (lambda x: lambda obj, value: setattr(self.attr, x, value))(sub)
#             ))
#
# but finally I came with a solution using next function.
#
#     for sub in some_subattributes:
#         setattr(cls, sub, property(*subaccessors('attr', sub)))
#
def subaccessors(*args):
    """Getter and setter functions for recursive attributes.

    This is best understood with an example. Say you have recursively
    aggregated several objects, so you can access a deep attribute like this:

    avalue = a.b.c.d
    a.b.c.d = anothervalue

    This function provides getter and setter methods, so we can access the
    inner attribute like this:

    getter, setter = subaccessors('b', 'c', 'd')
    avalue = getter(a)
    setter(a, anothervalue)

    Args:
        *args (str): Name of recursive attributes.

        getter (callable): accesor to get the value of the deep attribute
        setter (callable): accesor to set the value of the deep attribute
