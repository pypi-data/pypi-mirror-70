Description: HDHRHTTPAPI
        -----------
        
        This is a small library to retrieve information from HD HomeRun devices through the HTTP API and Python 3.
        
        Background
        ----------
        
        The [HDHomeRun products](https://www.silicondust.com/hdhomerun/) from SiliconDust are basically network TV tuners that broadcast the TV from 
        your cable or antenna to your network. These devices has one or more built-in TV tunners so it allows to
        stream the TV channels to the [SiliconDust](http://www.silicondust.com) and third-party applications.
        
        There are several libraries for different lenguages to communicate to HDHomeRun devices but I develop this
        library to use with homeassistant, a home automation software, to allow it to know the state of the tunners.
        
        As homeassistant is developed in Python and has some restrictions to access directly to the I/O hardware, so 
        this library has only some functions needed for my custom component for home assistant.
        
        The goals of this project were as follows:
        
        - Be able to discover the device(s) on the local network.
        - Be able to poll for status.
        - For a tuner to be able to get the current channel.
        
        All goals have been completed.
        
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        
        - There is not other additional requirements than Python 3.8. Other versions not tested.
