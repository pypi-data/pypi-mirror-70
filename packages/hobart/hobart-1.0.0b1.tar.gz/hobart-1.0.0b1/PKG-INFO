        Obtain cross sections of polygonal meshes.
        
        This library is optimized for cloud computation, however it depends on both
        [NumPy][] and [the SciPy k-d tree][ckdtree]. It's designed for use with
        [lacecore][].
        
        Currently works only with triangular meshes.
        
        Prior to version 1.0, this was a library for rendering mesh cross sections to
        SVG. That library has been renamed to [hobart-svg][].

        ## Acknowledgements
        
        This library was based on code in [Lace][], which was refactored from legacy
        code at Body Labs by [Alex Weiss][], with portions by [Eric Rachlin][],
        [Paul Melnikow][], [Victor Alvarez][], and others. Later it was extracted
        from the Body Labs codebase and open-sourced by [Guillaume Marceau][]. In
        2018 it was [forked by Paul Melnikow][fork] and published as
        [metabolace][fork pypi]. Thanks to a repository and package transfer from
        Body Labs, the fork has been merged back into the original.
