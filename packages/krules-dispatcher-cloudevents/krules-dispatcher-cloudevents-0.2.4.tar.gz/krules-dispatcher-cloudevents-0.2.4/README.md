# krules-dispatcher-cloudevents

This is the KRules's router dispatcher component. It sends cloudevents via http to a configurable url

KRules is a rules engine primarily intended to run on Kubernetes. 
However the core can be easily used even in different contexts. 
In addition to the core part, you need at least one subject implementation

**NOTE**: the project is at an early stage of development. 
The documentation is not yet available and we do not guarantee 
in any way backwards compatibility and support. Use it at your own risk
