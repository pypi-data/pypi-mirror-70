laserbeamsize
=============

Simple and fast calculation of beam sizes from a single monochrome image based
on the ISO 11146 method of variances.  Some effort has been made to make the 
algorithm less sensitive to background offset and noise.

Installation
------------

Just use pip::

   pip install laserbeamsize

Usage
-----

Finding the center and dimensions of a good beam image::

    import imageio
    import laserbeamsize as lbs

    beam = imageio.imread("t-hene.pgm")
    x, y, dx, dy, phi = lbs.beam_size(beam)

    print("The image center is at (%g, %g)" % (x,y))
    print("The horizontal width is %.1f pixels" % dx)
    print("The vertical height is %.1f pixels" % dy)
    print("The beam oval is rotated is %.1fÂ°" % (phi*180/3.1416))

Handling non-zero backgrounds and other issues are explained in Jupyter 
notebooks at <https://laserbeamsize.readthedocs.io>
