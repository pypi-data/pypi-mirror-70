Developing Lewis
================

To develop Lewis, it is strongly recommended to work in a dedicated virtualenv, otherwise
it is not possible to have another version of Lewis installed system wide in parallel. See
the :ref:`virtual_environments` section for a very quick introduction into creating and
activating a virtual environment.

With the virtual environment activated, checkout the source:

::

    (lewis-dev)$ git clone https://github.com/DMSC-Instrument-Data/lewis.git

Then, Lewis can be installed as an editable package:

::

    (lewis-dev)$ cd lewis
    (lewis-dev)$ pip install ".[dev]"

Now the Lewis package that resides in ``src`` can be modified, while it is still treated like a
normal package that has been installed via ``pip``. To make sure that everything is working as
intended, run the unit tests and check for pep8 errors, as well as build the documentation:

::

    (lewis-dev)$ pytest test
    (lewis-dev)$ flake8 src test setup.py
    (lewis-dev)$ sphinx-build -W -b html docs/ docs/_build/html

A more comprehensive way of running all tests is to use ``tox``, which creates fresh virtual
environments for all of these tasks:

::

    (lewis-dev)$ tox

The advantage of tox is that it generates a source package from the source tree and installs
it in the virtual environments that it creates, testing closer to the thing that is actually
installed in the end. Running all the verification steps this way takes a bit longer, so during
development it might be more desirable to just run the components that are necessary.

Development should happen in a separate branch. If the work is related to a specific issue,
it is good practice to include the issue number in the branch name, along with a short
summary of a few words, for example:

::

    (lewis-dev)$ git checkout -b 123_enhance_logic_flow

It's also good practice to push the branch back to github from time to time, so that other
members of the development team can see what's going on (even before a pull request is opened):

::

    (lewis-dev)$ git push origin 123_enhance_logic_flow

During development it is good practice to regularly test that changes do not break existing
or new tests. Before opening a pull request on github (which will run all the tests again
under different Python environments via Travis CI), it is recommended to run tox one last time
locally, as that resembles the conditions in the CI environment quite closely.
