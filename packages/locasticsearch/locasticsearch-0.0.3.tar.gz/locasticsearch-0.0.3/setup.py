Thanks to the API compatiblity with the official client, you can smoothly transition to Elasticsearch for scale or more features without changing your code.\n\n## Install\n\n```bash\npip install locasticsearch\n```\n\n## To use or not to use\n\nYou should NOT use Locasticsearch if:\n\n- you are deploying a security sensitive application. Locasticsearch code is very prone to SQL injection attacks. This should improve in future releases.\n- Your searches are more complicated than what you would find in a 5 min Elasticsearch tutorial. Elasticsearch has a huge API and it is very unlikely that we can support even a sizable portion of that.\n- You hate buggy libraries. Locasticsearch is a very young project so bugs are guaranteed. You can check the tests to see if your needs are covered. \n\nYou should use Locasticsearch if:\n\n- you dont want a docker or an elasticsearch service using precious resources in your laptop\n- you only need basic text search and Elasticsearch would be overkill\n- you want very easy deployments that only involve pip installs\n- using Java from a python program makes you feel dirty\n\n\n## Next steps\n\n- [] Add a real query DSL parsing\n- [] Add simplified non ES compatible interface for easy JSON ingestion, querying\n- [] Document supported vs unsupported query types\n\n\n## Comparison to similar libraries\n\n### [whoosh](https://whoosh.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html)\n\nThe most full featured **pure python** text search library by far:\n\n- üëç Supports highlight, analyzers, query expansion, several ranking functions, ...  \n- üëé Unmaintained for a long time might see a revival at https://github.com/whoosh-community/whoosh \n- üëç Pure python so doesnt scale as well (still fast enough for small medium datasets) \n\n### [elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co)\n\nThe big champion of full text search. This is what you should be using in production:\n\n- üëç Lots of features to accomodate any use case\n- üëç Battle tested, scalable, performant\n- üëé Non python native: more complex to deploy/integrate with python project for easy use cases\n\n\n### [django haystack](https://django-haystack.readthedocs.io/en/master/)\n\nDjango Haystack provides an unified API that allows you to plug in different search backends (such as Solr, Elasticsearch, Whoosh, Xapian, etc.) without having to modify your code:\n\n- üëç Many features, boosting, highlight, autocomplete (some backend dependent though)\n- üëç Possibility to switch backends\n- üëé Library lock in.\n- üëé Despite supporting several backends, Whoosh is the only one that is python native.\n\n\n### [xapian](https://xapian.org/docs/bindings/python/)\n\n- üëç Very fast and full featured (C++) \n- üëé No pip installable (needs system level compilation)\n- üëé The python bindings and the documentation are not that user friendly\n\n\n### [gensim](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/)\n\nWhile gensim focuses on topic modeling you can use `TfidfModel` and `SparseMatrixSimilarity` for text search. That said this is doesnt use an inverted index (linear search) so it has limited scalability.\n\n- üëç Unique features such as approximate search\n- üëé Focus is on topic modeling, so no intuitive APIs for full text ingestion/search\n- üëé Doesnt support inverted indexes search (mostly full scan and approximate)\n\n\n### [peewee](http://docs.peewee-orm.com/en/latest/)\n\nPeewee is actually a more general ORM but offers abstractions to use full text search on Sqlite.\n\n- üëç Support for full text search using several SQL backends (no elasticsearch though)\n- üëç Custom ranking and analyzer functions\n- üëé No elasticsearch compatible API\n\n\n',
