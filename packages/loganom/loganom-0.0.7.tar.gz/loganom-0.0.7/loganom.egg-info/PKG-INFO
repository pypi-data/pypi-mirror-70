        **loganom** is a tool that checks log files in search for anomalies.
        Many small and medium companies that have only local users (in the
        same country) can use loganom.
        
        The first processor check postfix sasl authentication.
        
        Usually when an account is compromised, attackers use several machines
        from their botnets to send emails (spam/virus/phishing/etc) with that
        credential.
        
        This can be observed when a user that usually connects from the same
        country, suddenly send emails from all around the world.
        
        This is an experimental program.
