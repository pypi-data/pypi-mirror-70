An ordered, one-to-many mapping.

Install
-------

.. code-block:: shell

   $ pip install -U magicdict

Thread Safety
-------------
:code:`FrozenMagicDict` and its subclasses should be thread safe without additional
locking. If any data races occurred, then that's a bug. Please file an issue
with reproducing procedure.

Usage
-----
:code:`MagicDict` should function like :code:`collections.OrderedDict` except
:code:`move_to_end` is not defined and :code:`d[key]` always returns the first
item.

:code:`FrozenMagicDict` is an immutable version of :code:`MagicDict`.

:code:`FrozenTolerantMagicDict` and :code:`TolerantMagicDict` are
case-insensitive versions of :code:`FrozenMagicDict` and :code:`MagicDict`
respectively.

:code:`get_first`, :code:`get_last`, :code:`get_iter`, and :code:`get_list`:
These methods are available in `FrozenMagicDict` and its subclasses.
For more details, please read the comments of each method.

:code:`add`:
Method :code:`add` is available in :code:`MagicDict` and
:code:`TolerantMagicDict`. This method is used as an substitution of
:code:`dic[key] = value` as it can append a value to the
dictionary without removing the existing one. Setting values like normal
:code:`OrderedDict` will clear the stored value(s) if any.
