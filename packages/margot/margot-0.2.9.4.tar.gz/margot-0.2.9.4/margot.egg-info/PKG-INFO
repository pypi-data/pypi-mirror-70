Description: 
        An algorithmic trading framework for pydata.
        ============================================
        
        Margot is a library of two parts that may be used together or separately:
        
        
        * margot.data
        * margot.backtest
        
        Margot Data
        ===========
        
        The first component is margot.data.
        
        Margot manages data collection, cleaning and assemblance of time series into a nicely
        organised Pandas Dataframe using a clean, declarative API. If you've ever used Django
        you'll find this approach very similar to the Django ORM.
        
        Columns
        -------
        
        Margot can retreive time series data from external sources, like AlphaVantage. To add 
        a time series such as "closing_price" or "volume", we declare a Column.
        
        e.g. to get closing_price from AlphaVantage:
        
        .. code-block::
        
           adj_close = av.Column(function='historical_daily_adjusted', column='adjusted_close')
        
        
        Features
        --------
        
        Columns are useful, but we usually want to derived another time series from them, such 
        as "returns" or "SMA20". Margot does this for you; we call them Features.
        
        .. code-block::
        
           simple_returns = feature.SimpleReturns(column='adjusted_close')
           log_returns = feature.LogReturns(column='adjusted_close')
           sma20 = feature.SimpleMovingAverage(column='adjusted_close', window=20)
        
        
        Margot Data includes many common financial Features, and it's very easy to add more.
        
        Symbols
        -------
        
        Often, you want to make a dataframe combining a number of these columns and features.
        Margot makes this very easy. e.g.
        
        .. code-block::
        
           class MyEquity(Symbol):
        
               adjusted_close = av.Column(function='historical_daily_adjusted', column='adjusted_close')
               log_returns = feature.LogReturns(column='adjusted_close')
               realised_vol = feature.RealisedVolatility(column='log_returns', window=30)
               upper_band = feature.UpperBollingerBand(column='adjusted_close', window=20, width=2.0)
               sma20 = feature.SimpleMovingAverage(column='adjusted_close', window=20)
               lower_band = feature.LowerBollingerBand(column='adjusted_close', window=20, width=2.0)
        
           spy = MyEquity(symbol='SPY)
        
        
        MargotDataFrames
        ----------------
        
        In systematic trading, you usually you want to look at more than one symbol. That's where
        ensembles come in. MargotDataFrame really brings power to margot.data.
        
        .. code-block::
        
           class MyEnsemble(MargotDataFrame):
               spy = Equity(symbol='SPY')
               iwm = Equity(symbol='IWM')
               spy_iwm_ratio = Ratio(numerator=spy.adjusted_close, 
                                     denominator=iwm.adjusted_close,
                                     label='spy_iwm_ratio')
        
           my_df = MyEnsemble().to_pandas() 
        
        
        Margot backtest
        ===============
        
        **margot.backtest isn't yet included in this release.**
        
        Margot backtest provides a base class to inherit to define your trading algorithm, an
        implementation of a walk-forward backetesting algorithm that produced backtests of
        your algorithm using margot.data. 
        
        Results from margot backtest can be analysed with pyfolio.
        
        Status
        ------
        
        This is still an early stage software project, and should not be used for live trading.
        
        Getting Started
        ---------------
        
        .. code-block::
        
           pip install margot

        Feel free to make a pull request or chat about your idea first using `issues <https://github.com/atkinson/margot/issues>`_.
        
        Dependencies are kept to a minimum. Generally if there's a way to do something in the standard library (or numpy / Pandas), let's do it that way rather than add another library.
