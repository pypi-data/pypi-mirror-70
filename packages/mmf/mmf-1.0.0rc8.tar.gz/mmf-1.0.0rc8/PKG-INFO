        **NOTE**: MMF is still in beta mode and will replace Pythia framework.
        To get the latest Pythia code which doesn't contain MMF changes, please use the following command:
        
        ```
        git clone --branch v0.3 https://github.com/facebookresearch/mmf pythia
        ```
        
        MMF is a modular framework for vision and language multimodal research. Built on top of PyTorch, it features:
        
        - **Model Zoo**: Reference implementations for state-of-the-art vision and language model including
        [LoRRA](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.08920) (SoTA on VQA and TextVQA),
        [Pythia](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.09956) model (VQA 2018 challenge winner), [BAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.07932) and [BUTD](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.07998).
        - **Multi-Tasking**: Support for multi-tasking which allows training on multiple dataset together.
        - **Datasets**: Includes support for various datasets built-in including VQA, VizWiz, TextVQA, VisualDialog and COCO Captioning.
        - **Modules**: Provides implementations for many commonly used layers in vision and language domain
        - **Distributed**: Support for distributed training based on DataParallel as well as DistributedDataParallel.
        - **Unopinionated**: Unopinionated about the dataset and model implementations built on top of it.
        - **Customization**: Custom losses, metrics, scheduling, optimizers, tensorboard; suits all your custom needs.
        
        You can use MMF to **_bootstrap_** for your next vision and language multimodal research project.
        
        MMF can also act as **starter codebase** for challenges around vision and
        language datasets (TextVQA challenge, VQA challenge). MMF was formerly known as Pythia.
