        Running the tests
        -----------------
        
        Tests can be run by executing the **tox** commend inside the root directory of the project.
        
        .. code-block:: shell
        
                $ tox
        
        This command will run all the tests.
        
        
        
        Setting up integration tests
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        For the integration tests 2 environment variables are needed *mocotest_apikey* and *mocotest_domain*. Set them like this
        
        .. code-block:: shell
                
                $ export mocotest_apikey="this is the api key"
                $ export mocotest_domain="testdomain"
