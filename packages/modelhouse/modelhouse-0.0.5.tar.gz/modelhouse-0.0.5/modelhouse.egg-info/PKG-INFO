Description: # modelhouse
        
        ## Why?
        
        **The purpose of `modelhouse` is to make it easy to distribute models to workers on cloud.**
        
        With `modelhouse`, you can store and load your models from different storage backends (Google Cloud Storage, AWS S3, local). `modelhouse` also provides model caching, which can significantly reduce model loading time while keeping memory utilization low.
        
        ## Installation
