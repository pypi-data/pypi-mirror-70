# monero-python

This is an empty package just to make sure the old name is not taken by someone with malicious intentions.

The original repository's `README` contains the following message:

> **Warning**
>
> With release 0.6 the project name at PyPi has changed from monero-python to monero. Please update your dependency files.

The new package can be found here: https://pypi.org/project/monero/
