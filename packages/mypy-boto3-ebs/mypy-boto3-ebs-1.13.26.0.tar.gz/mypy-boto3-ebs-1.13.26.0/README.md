## How to use

Make sure you have [mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy) installed and activated in your IDE.

Install `boto3-stubs` for `EBS` service.

```bash
python -m pip install boto3-stubs[ebs]

# update installed packages index for automated type discovery
python -m mypy_boto3
```

Use `boto3` with `mypy_boto3_ebs` in your project and enjoy type checking and auto-complete.

```python
import boto3

from mypy_boto3_ebs import EBSClient

# Now mypy can check if your code is valid.
client: EBSClient = boto3.client("ebs")

# works for session as well
session = boto3.session.Session(region="us-west-1")
session_client: EBSClient = session.client("ebs")

```

## Automated type discovery

`mypy_boto3` package can generate index for `mypy_boto3_ebs` and other installed services.

```bash
# Run this command when you add or remove service packages
python -m mypy_boto3
```

Generated index provides overloads for `boto3.client` and `boto3.service`,
`boto3.Session.client` and `boto3.Session.resource` functions,
so explicit type annotations are not needed.

- `mypy` supports function overloads as expected
- `PyCharm` also supports function overloads, but consumes a lot of RAM, use carefully
- `VSCode` does not currently support function overloads

Also, generated index allows you to import types from `mypy_boto3`:

```python
# you can replace imports
import mypy_boto3_ebs as ebs
from mypy_boto3_ebs import EBSClient

# with these
from mypy_boto3 import ebs
from mypy_boto3.ebs import EBSClient
```
