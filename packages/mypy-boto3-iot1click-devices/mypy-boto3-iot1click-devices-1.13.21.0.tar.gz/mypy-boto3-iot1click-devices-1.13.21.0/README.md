## How to use

### Type checking

Make sure you have [mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy) installed and activated in your IDE.

Install `boto3-stubs` for `IoT1ClickDevicesService` service.

```bash
python -m pip install boto3-stubs[iot1click-devices]

# update installed packages index
mypy_boto3
```

Use `boto3` with `mypy_boto3` in your project and enjoy type checking and auto-complete.

```python
import boto3

from mypy_boto3 import iot1click_devices
# alternative import if you do not want to install mypy_boto3 package
# import mypy_boto3_iot1click_devices as iot1click_devices

# Use this client as usual, now mypy can check if your code is valid.
# Check if your IDE supports function overloads,
# you probably do not need explicit type annotations
# client = boto3.client("iot1click-devices")
client: iot1click_devices.IoT1ClickDevicesServiceClient = boto3.client("iot1click-devices")

# works for session as well
session = boto3.session.Session(region="us-west-1")
session_client: iot1click_devices.IoT1ClickDevicesServiceClient = session.client("iot1click-devices")


# Paginators need type annotation on creation
list_device_events_paginator: iot1click_devices.ListDeviceEventsPaginator = client.get_paginator("list_device_events")
list_devices_paginator: iot1click_devices.ListDevicesPaginator = client.get_paginator("list_devices")
```

## How it works

Fully automated [builder](https://github.com/vemel/mypy_boto3_builder) carefully generates
type annotations for each service, patiently waiting for `boto3` updates. It delivers
a drop-in type annotations for you and makes sure that:

- All available `boto3` services are covered.
- Each public class and method of every `boto3` service gets valid type annotations
  extracted from the documentation (blame `botocore` docs if types are incorrect).
- Type annotations include up-to-date documentation.
- Link to documentation is provided for every method.
- Code is processed by [black](https://github.com/psf/black) for readability.
