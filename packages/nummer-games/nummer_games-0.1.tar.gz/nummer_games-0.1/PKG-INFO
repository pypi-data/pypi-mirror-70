Description: # The Number Game
        
        This Python module allows you to guess random numbers within your selected
        number of attempts. It also allows you to guess Prime numbers within your
        selected number of attempts.
        
        ## Instructions
        - Enter your terminal
        
        - Install the module:
            - ```pip install nummer```
        
        - Enter your python interactive shell:
            - ```python```
        
        - Import required functions:
            - ```from nummer import Classify, Prime```
        
        - Iterate through attempts by guessing random numbers:
            - ```Classify(n).guess_number()```
        
        - Iterate through attempts by guessing prime numbers:
            - ```Prime(n).guess_prime_number()```
        
        - Note:
            - n represents the number of attempts
        
        - Illustration
