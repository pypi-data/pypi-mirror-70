This Python module allows you to guess random numbers within your selected
number of attempts. It also allows you to guess Prime numbers within your
selected number of attempts.

## Instructions

- Install the module:
    - ```pip install nummer-games```

- Enter your python interactive shell:
    - ```python```

- Import required functions:
    - ```from nummer_games import Classify, Prime```

- Iterate through attempts by guessing random numbers:
    - ```Classify(n).guess_number()```

- Iterate through attempts by guessing prime numbers:
    - ```Prime(n).guess_prime_number()```

- Note:
    - n represents the number of attempts

- Illustration
