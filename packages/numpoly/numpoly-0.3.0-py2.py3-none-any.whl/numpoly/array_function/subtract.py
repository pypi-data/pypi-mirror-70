    Subtract arguments, element-wise.

    Args:
        x1, x2 (numpoly.ndpoly):
            The arrays to be subtracted from each other. If
            ``x1.shape != x2.shape``, they must be broadcastable to a common
            shape (which becomes the shape of the output).
        out (Optional[numpy.ndarray]):
            A location into which the result is stored. If provided, it must
            have a shape that the inputs broadcast to. If not provided or
            `None`, a freshly-allocated array is returned. A tuple (possible
            only as a keyword argument) must have length equal to the number of
            outputs.
        where (Union[bool, numpy.ndarray]):
            This condition is broadcast over the input. At locations where the
            condition is True, the `out` array will be set to the ufunc result.
            Elsewhere, the `out` array will retain its original value. Note
            that if an uninitialized `out` array is created via the default
            ``out=None``, locations within it where the condition is False will
            remain uninitialized.
        kwargs:
            Keyword args passed to numpy.ufunc.

    Returns:
        (numpoly.ndpoly):
            The difference of `x1` and `x2`, element-wise. This is a scalar if
            both `x1` and `x2` are scalars.

    Examples:
        >>> x, y = numpoly.symbols("x y")
        >>> numpoly.subtract(x, 4)
        polynomial(x-4)
        >>> poly1 = x**numpy.arange(9).reshape((3, 3))
        >>> poly2 = y**numpy.arange(3)
        >>> numpoly.subtract(poly1, poly2)
        polynomial([[0, -y+x, -y**2+x**2],
                    [x**3-1, x**4-y, x**5-y**2],
                    [x**6-1, x**7-y, x**8-y**2]])
