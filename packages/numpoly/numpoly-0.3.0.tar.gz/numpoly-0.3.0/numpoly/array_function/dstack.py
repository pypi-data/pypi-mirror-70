    """
    Stack arrays in sequence depth wise (along third axis).

    This is equivalent to concatenation along the third axis after 2-D arrays
    of shape `(M,N)` have been reshaped to `(M,N,1)` and 1-D arrays of shape
    `(N,)` have been reshaped to `(1,N,1)`. Rebuilds arrays divided by
    `dsplit`.

    This function makes most sense for arrays with up to 3 dimensions. For
    instance, for pixel-data with a height (first axis), width (second axis),
    and r/g/b channels (third axis). The functions `concatenate`, `stack` and
    `block` provide more general stacking and concatenation operations.

    Args:
        tup (Sequence[numpoly.ndpoly]):
            The arrays must have the same shape along all but the third axis.
            1-D or 2-D arrays must have the same shape.

    Returns:
        (numpoly.ndpoly):
            The array formed by stacking the given arrays, will be at least
            3-D.

    Examples:
        >>> a = numpoly.symbols("x y z")
        >>> b = numpoly.polynomial([1, 2, 3])
        >>> numpoly.dstack([a, b])
        polynomial([[[x, 1],
                     [y, 2],
                     [z, 3]]])
        >>> c = numpoly.polynomial([[1], [2], [3]])
        >>> d = a.reshape(3, 1)
        >>> numpoly.dstack([c, d])
        polynomial([[[1, x]],
        <BLANKLINE>
                    [[2, y]],
        <BLANKLINE>
                    [[3, z]]])
