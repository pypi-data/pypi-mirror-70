        openedx-completion-aggregator is a Django app that aggregates block level
        completion data for different block types for Open edX.
        
        Overview
        --------
        
        openedx-completion-aggregator uses the pluggable django app pattern to
        ease installation.  To use in edx-platform, do the following:
        
        1.  Install the app into your virtualenv.
        
            ..code_block::
        
                $ pip install openedx-completion-aggregator
        
        2.  [Optional] You may override the set of registered aggregator block types in
            your lms.env.json file::
        
                ...
                "COMPLETION_AGGREGATOR_BLOCK_TYPES": {
                    "course",
                    "chapter",
                    "subsection",
                    "vertical"
                },
                ...
        
        
        3.  By default, completion is aggregated with each created or updated
            BlockCompletion.  If this creates too much database activity for your
            installation, set the following in your lms.env.json file::
        
                ...
                "COMPLETION_AGGREGATOR_ASYNC_AGGREGATION": true,
                ...
        
            Then configure up a pair of cron jobs to run `./manage.py
            run_aggregator_service` and `./manage.py run_aggregator_cleanup` as often
            as desired.
        
        Note that if operating on a Hawthorne-or-later release of edx-platform, you may
        override the settings in `EDXAPP_ENV_EXTRA` instead.
