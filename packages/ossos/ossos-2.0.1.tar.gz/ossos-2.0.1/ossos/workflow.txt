OSSOS pipeline workflow.

run_pipeline.py  # overall pipeline management script. 
		 # update of src/jjk/preproc/scrample.py to OSSOS (now redistributed to smaller files)

sunrise:
	# chronjob runs at sunrise each Hawaiian morning after observing has finished. 
	# retrieve image info from CADC via TAP: incorporate src/jjk/preproc/ObsStatus.py
	# examine for contiguous image sets, images missing from ends of each field's observing
	# populate OSSOS metadata db, ossuary, with info
	# process info to see if any fields in that batch of observation had three images in the night
	# report via email on result of night's observing
	# \copy postgres_db to stdout with csv header  (this'll be a daily dump of the db to disk) # aha: pg_dump 
	# if fields > 0, initiate next step of processing, preproc.

preproc:
	# given fields with > 3 images in the night:
	# flatfield and biases if there is a flat available (check when/why no flat available)
	# run Stephan's wcs astrometry module to replace the headers
	# flip the images to have north up, east left
	# makepsf
