        This is a `LDAP <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_Directory_Access_Protocol>`_ Plugin for the `Zope <http://www.zope.org/en/latest/>`_ `Pluggable Authentication Service (PAS) <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Products.PluggableAuthService>`_.
        
        It provides users and/or groups from an LDAP directory.
        
        It works in a plain Zope even if it depends on `PlonePAS <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Products.PlonePAS>`_.
        
        If `Plone <https://plone.org>`_ is installed an integration layer with a setup-profile and a plone-controlpanel page is available.
        
        ``pas.plugins.ldap`` is **not** releated to the old LDAPUserFolder/ LDAPMultiPlugins and the packages (i.e. PloneLDAP) stacked on top of it in any way.
        
        It is based on **node.ext.ldap**, an almost framework independent LDAP stack.
        
        For now users and groups can't be added or deleted. Properties on both are read/write.
        
        See section *TODO*.
        
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        Dependencies
        ------------
        
        This package depends on ``python-ldap``.
        
        To build it correctly you need to have some development libraries included in your system.
        
        On a Debian-based installation use:
        
        .. code-block:: console
        
            sudo apt install python-dev libldap2-dev libsasl2-dev libssl-dev
        
        
        Zope
        ----
        
        Add to the instance section of your buildout:
        
        .. code-block:: ini
        
            eggs =
                ...
                pas.plugins.ldap
        
            zcml =
                ...
                pas.plugins.ldap
        
        Run buildout. Restart Zope.
        
        Browse to your ``acl_users`` folder and add an LDAP-Plugin.
        
        Configure it using the settings form and activate its features with the ``activate`` tab.
        
        
        Plone
        -----
        
        Add to the instance section of your buildout:
        
        .. code-block:: ini
        
            eggs =
                ...
                pas.plugins.ldap
        
        Run buildout. Restart Plone.
        
        Then go to the Plone control-panel, select ``extensions`` and install the LDAP Plugin.
        
        A new LDAP Settings icon appear on the left. Click it and configure the plugin there.
        
        To use an own integration-profile, add to the profiles ``metadata.xml`` file:
        
        .. code-block:: xml
        
            ...
            <dependencies>
                ...
                <dependency>profile-pas.plugins.ldap.plonecontrolpanel:default</dependency>
            </dependencies>
            ...
        
        Additionally ldap settings can be exported and imported with ``portal_setup``.
        You can place the exported ``ldapsettings.xml`` in your integration profile, so it will be imported with your next install again.
        
        **Warning:**
        
        **The LDAP-password is stored in there in plain text!**
        
        But anonymous bindings are possible.
        
        
        Logging
        -------
        
        To get detailed output of all LDAP-operations and much more set the logging level to debug.
        Attention, this is lots of output.
        
        LDAP as an external service might be down, non-responsive or slow.
        This package logs such events to raise awareness.
        There are two environment variables to control the logging of LDAP-errors:
        
        PAS_PLUGINS_LDAP_ERROR_LOG_TIMEOUT
            First LDAP-error is logged, further errors ignored until the given number of seconds have passed.
            This supresses flooding logs if LDAP is down.
            Default: 300.0 (time in seconds, float).
        
        PAS_PLUGINS_LDAP_LONG_RUNNING_LOG_THRESHOLD
            Log long running LDAP/PAS operations.
            If a PAS operation takes longer than he given number of seconds, log it as error.
            Default: 5 (time in seconds, float).
        
        
        Caching
        -------
        
        **Without caching this module is slow** (as any other module talking to LDAP will be).
        
        By **default** the LDAP-queries are **not cached**.
        
        A **must have** for a production environment is having `memcached <http://memcached.org/>`_ server configured as LDAP query cache.
        
        Cache at least for ~6 seconds, so a page load with all its resources is covered also in worst case.
        
        The UGM tree is cached by default on the request, that means its built up every request from (cached) ldap queries.
        
        There is an alternative adapter available which will cache the ugm tree as volatile attribute (``_v_...``) on the persistent plugin.
        
        Volatile attributes are not persisted in the ZODB.
        If the plugin object vanishes from ZODB cache the atrribute is gone.
        
        The volatile plugin cache can be activated by loading its zcml with ``<include package="pas.plugins.ldap" file="cache_volatile.zcml"``.
        
        The caching time can be influenced by overriding the value in ``pas.plugins.ldap.cache.VOLATILE_CACHE_MAXAGE``.
        
        It defaults to 10 and its unit is seconds.
        
        **Note:**
        
        **Caching the UGM tree longer than one request means it could contain outdated data.**
        
        If you plan a different implementation of UGM tree caching,provide your own adapter implementing ``pas.plugins.ldap.interfaces.IPluginCacheHandler``.
        
        
        Limitations and Future Optimizations
        ====================================
        
        This package was not tested/developed with Windows.
        It may work under Windows if ``python-ldap`` is installed properly and recognized by buildout.
        
        This package works fine for several 10000 users or groups, **unless you list users**.
        
        This is not that much a problem for small amount of users.
        There is room for future optimization in the underlying `node.ext.ldap <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/node.ext.ldap>`_.

          Thanks @datakurre for reporting!
          [jensens]
        
        
        1.5 (2016-10-06)
        ----------------
        
        - No changes.
        
        
        1.5b1 (2016-09-09)
        ------------------
        
        - GroupEnumeration paged.

        - Fixed LDAP errors not handled. This prevent leave the site broken
          just after the installation of the plugin
          [keul]
        
        - Adopt LDAP instector to use DN instead of RDN for node identification.
          [rnix]
        
        - Add dummy ``defaults`` setting to ``UsersConfig`` and ``GroupsConfig``
          adapters. These defaults are used to set child creation defaults, thus
          concrete implementation is postponed until user and group creation is
          supported through plone UI.
          [rnix]
        
        - Add ``ignore_cert`` setting to ``LDAPProps`` adapter.
          [rnix]
        
        - Remove ``check_duplicates`` setting which is not available any more in
          node.ext.ldap.
          [rnix]
        
        - Use node.ext.ldap 1.0b1.
          [rnix]
        
        - major speedup expected by using node.ext.ldap >=1.0a1
          [jensens]
        
        - use implementer decorator for better readability.
          [jensens]
        
        - Fix setuptools to v7.0.
          [jensens]
        
        
        1.4.0 (2014-10-24)
        ------------------
        
        - Feature: Alternative volatile cache for UGM tree on plugin.
          [jensens]
        
        - overhaul test setup
          [jensens]
        
        - introduce pluggable caching mechanism on ugm-tree level, defaults to
          caching on request. Can be overruled by providing an adapter implementing
          ``pas.plugins.ldap.interfaces.IPluginCacheHandler``.
          [jensens]
        
        - log how long it takes to build up a users or groups tree.
          [jensens]
        
        1.3.2 (2014-09-10)
        ------------------
        
        - Small fixes in inspector.
          [rnix]
        
        
        1.3.1 (2014-08-05)
        ------------------
        
        - Fix dependency versions.
          [rnix]
        
        
        1.3.0 (2014-05-12)
        ------------------
        
        - Raise ``RuntimeError`` instead of ``KeyError`` when password change method
          couldn't locate the user in LDAP tree. Maybe it's a local user and
          ``Products.PlonePAS.pas.userSetPassword`` expects a ``RuntimeError`` to be
          raised in this case.
          [saily]
        
        
        1.2.0 (2014-03-13)
        ------------------
        
        - add property ``check_duplicates``. Adds ability to disable duplicates check
          for keys in ldap in order to avoid failure if ldap strcuture is not perfect.
        
        - Add new property to disable duplicate primary/secondary key checking
          in LDAP trees. This allows pas.plugins.ldap to read LDAP tree and ignore
          duplicated items instead of raising::
        
            Traceback (most recent call last):
            ...
            RuntimeError: Key not unique: <key>='<value>'.
        
        
        1.1.0 (2014-03-03)
        ------------------
        
        - ldap errors dont block that much if ldap is not reachable,
          timeout blocked in past the whole zope. now default timeout for retry is
          300s - and some code cleanup
          [jensens]
        
        - use more modern base for testing
          [jensens]
        
        - Add URL example to widget help information how to specify an ldap uri.
          [saily]
        
        - Add new bootstrap v2

        - sometimes ldap returns an empty string as portrait. take this as no portrait.

        1.0.1
        -----
        
        - because of passwordreset problem we figured out that pas searchUsers calls
          plugins search with both login and name, which was passed to ugm and returned
          always an empty result
