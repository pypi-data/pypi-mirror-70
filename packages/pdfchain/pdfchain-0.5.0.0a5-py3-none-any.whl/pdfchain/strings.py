def validate_page_selection_string(str_input):
    '''
    @brief   Validate page selection string from Concatenate File Filter entry.
    @details
        This functions normalizes and validates page selection strings.
        Before the validation the string becomes normalized.
        Normalization means the string becomes transformed
        to a unique PDFtk convented pattern.
        This is possible for PDFtk standardized strings
        and when the string equates a clear, comma separated pattern style.
        Mixing the styles is possible.

    @par Strings and Characters
        - `end`: indicates last page of document
        - `r`:   indicates reverse
        - `-`:   indicates connected pages
        - `,`:   indicates a separation of logical entities
        - ` `:   indicates a separation of logical

    @brief   Calculates the number of digits of a decimal number to another base.
    @details
        This function is needed in the burst section, when the number of digits

        It calculates the number of digits that this number needs for another base.
    @warning
        Does not work correct for negative numbers and bases!
    @note
        This function uses the `__floordiv__` operator `//`,
        for a "classic division" with truncated decimal places.
        `number //= base` equals `number = int(number / base)`

    @brief Quote and escape strings for the command line.
    @details
        This function is used to prepare strings like filenames
        and passwords for the command line.
    @note About quoting
        Inside a single quoted string is the single quote character `'`
        the only character which has to be handled.
        But there is no escape character which works inside a single quoted string.
        Therefore a single quoted string must be ended, the single quote escaped
        and the rest of the string restarts quoted again.

    @param[in] string The string to quote
    return            The quoted and escaped string
    '''
    return "'" + string.replace(r"'", r"'\''") + "'"
