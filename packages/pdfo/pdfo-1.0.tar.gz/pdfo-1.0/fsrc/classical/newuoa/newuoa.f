C
C     This subroutine seeks the least value of a function of many variables,
C     by a trust region method that forms quadratic models by interpolation.
C     There can be some freedom in the interpolation conditions, which is
C     taken up by minimizing the Frobenius norm of the change to the second
C     derivative of the quadratic model, beginning with a zero matrix. The
C     arguments of the subroutine are as follows.
C
C     N must be set to the number of variables and must be at least two.
C     NPT is the number of interpolation conditions. Its value must be in the
C       interval [N+2,(N+1)(N+2)/2].
C     Initial values of the variables must be set in X(1),X(2),...,X(N). They
C       will be changed to the values that give the least calculated F.
C     RHOBEG and RHOEND must be set to the initial and final values of a trust
C       region radius, so both must be positive with RHOEND<=RHOBEG. Typically
C       RHOBEG should be about one tenth of the greatest expected change to a
C       variable, and RHOEND should indicate the accuracy that is required in
C       the final values of the variables.
C     The value of IPRINT should be set to 0, 1, 2 or 3, which controls the
C       amount of printing. Specifically, there is no output if IPRINT=0 and
C       there is output only at the return if IPRINT=1. Otherwise, each new
C       value of RHO is printed, with the best vector of variables so far and
C       the corresponding value of the objective function. Further, each new
C       value of F with its variables are output if IPRINT=3.
C     MAXFUN must be set to an upper bound on the number of calls of CALFUN.
C     The array W will be used for working space. Its length must be at least
C     (NPT+13)*(NPT+N)+3*N*(N+3)/2.

C     F is the objective function value when the algorithm exit.
C     INFO is the exit flag, which can be set to:
C       0: the lower bound for the trust region radius is reached.
C       1: the target function value is reached.
C       2: a trust region step has failed to reduce the quadratic model.
C       3: the objective function has been evaluated MAXFUN times.
C       4: much cancellation in a denominator.
C       5: NPT is not in the required interval.
C       6: one of the difference XU(I)-XL(I) is less than 2*RHOBEG.
C       7: rounding errors are becoming damaging.
C       8: rounding errors prevent reasonable changes to X.
C       9: the denominator of the updating formule is zero.
C       10: N should not be less than 2.
C       11: MAXFUN is less than NPT+1.
C       12: the gradient of constraint is zero.
C       -1: NaN occurs in x.
C       -2: the objective function returns a NaN or nearly infinite
C           value.

C     SUBROUTINE CALFUN (N,X,F) must be provided by the user. It must set F to
C     the value of the objective function for the variables X(1),X(2),...,X(N).
C
C     Partition the working space array, so that different parts of it can be
C     treated separately by the subroutine that performs the main calculation.
