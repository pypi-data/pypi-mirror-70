def lincoa(fun, x0, args=(), bounds=None, constraints=(), options=None):
    """LINCOA: LINearly Constrained Optimization Algorithm

    M. J. D. Powell did not publish any paper introducing LINCOA.

    Parameters
    ----------
    fun: callable
        The objective function, which accepts a vector `x` at input and returns a scalar.
    x0: ndarray, shape (n,)
        The initial guess. The size of `x0` should be consistent with the objective function.
    args: tuple, optional
        The extra-arguments to pass to the objective function. For example,

            ``lincoa(fun, x0, args, ...)``

        is equivalent to

            ``lincoa(lambda x: fun(x, args), x0, ...)``

    bounds: ndarray of tuple with shape(n,2), or Bounds, optional
        Bound constraints of the problem. It can be one of the two cases below.
            1. An ndarray with shape(n,2). If the ndarray is 'bounds', then the bound constraint for x[i] is
                bounds[i, 0]<=x[i]<=bounds[i, 1]. Set bounds[i, 0] to -numpy.inf or None if there is no lower bound, and
                set bounds[i, 1] to numpy.inf or None if there is no upper bound.
            2. An instance of the `Bounds` class. Bounds(lb, ub) specifies a bound constraint lb<=x<=ub.
    constraints: LinearConstraint or a list of them, optional
        Linear constraints of the problem. It can be one of the two cases below.
            1. An instance of the `LinearConstraint` class.
                LinearConstraint(A, lb, ub) specifies a linear constraint lb<=A*x<=ub.
            2. A list of LinearConstraint.
    options: dict, optional
        The options passed to the solver. It is a structure that contains optionally:
            rhobeg: float, optional
                Initial value of the trust region radius, which should be a positive scalar. Typically,
                `options['rhobeg']` should be typically in the order of one tenth of the greatest expected change to a
                variable. By default, it is 1 if the problem is not scaled, 0.5 if the problem is scaled.
            rhoend: float, optional
                Final value of the trust region radius, which should be a positive scalar. `options['rhoend']` should
                indicate typically the accuracy required in the final values of the variables. Moreover,
                `options['rhoend']` should be no more than `options['rhobeg']` and is by default 1e-6.
            maxfev: int, optional
                Upper bound of the number of calls of the objective function `fun`. Its value must be not less than
                `options['npt']`+1. By default, it is 500*n.
            npt: int, optional
                Number of interpolation points of each model used in Powell's Fortran code. By default, it is 2*n+1.
            ftarget: float, optional
                Target value of the objective function. If a feasible iterate achieves an objective function value lower
                or equal to `options['ftarget']`, the algorithm stops immediately. By default, it is -numpy.inf.
            scale: bool, optional
                Flag indicating whether to scale the problem according to the bound constraints or not. By default, it
                is False. If the problem is to be scaled, then rhobeg and rhoend mentioned above will be used as the
                initial and final trust region radii for the scaled problem.
            quiet: bool, optional
                Flag of quietness of the interface. If it is set to True, the output message will not be printed. This
                flag does not interfere with the warning and error printing.
            classical: bool, optional
                Flag indicating whether to call the classical Powell code or not. By default, it is False.
            debug: bool, optional
                Debugging flag. By default, it is False.
            chkfunval: bool, optional
                Flag used when debugging. If both `options['debug']` and `options['chkfunval']` are True, an extra
                function evaluation would be performed to check whether the returned objective function value matches
                the returned x. By default, it is False.

    Returns
    -------
    res: OptimizeResult
        The results of the solver. Check ``pdfo.OptimizeResult`` for a description of the attributes.

    Notes
    -----
    The signature of this function is consistent with the `minimize` function available in ``scipy.optimize``, included
    in the SciPy package.

    See https://www.pdfo.net for more information.

    solves

    >>> options = {'maxfev': 200}
    >>> lincoa(obj, [0, 1], bounds=bounds, constraints=lin_con, options=options)

    solves
        min  x^2 + y^2
        s.t. 0 <= x <= 2
             0.5 <= y <= 3
             0 <= x + y <= 1
    starting from [x0, y0] = [0, 1] with at most 200 function evaluations.
