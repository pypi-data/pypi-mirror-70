    """UOBYQA: Unconstrained Optimization BY Quadratic Approximation

    The algorithm is described in [M. J. D. Powell, UOBYQA: unconstrained optimization by quadratic approximation, Math.
    Program., 92(B):555--582, 2002].

    Parameters
    ----------
    fun: callable
        The objective function, which accepts a vector `x` at input and returns a scalar.
    x0: ndarray, shape (n,)
        The initial guess. The size of `x0` should be consistent with the objective function.
    args: tuple, optional
        The extra-arguments to pass to the objective function. For example,

            ``uobyqa(fun, x0, args, options)``

        is equivalent to

            ``uobyqa(lambda x: fun(x, args), x0, options=options)``

    options: dict, optional
        The options passed to the solver. It is a structure that contains optionally:
            rhobeg: float, optional
                Initial value of the trust region radius, which should be a positive scalar. Typically, `options['rhobeg']`
                should in the order of  one tenth of the greatest expected change to a variable. By default, it is 1.
            rhoend: float, optional
                Final value of the trust region radius, which should be a positive scalar. `options['rhoend']` should
                indicate typically the accuracy required in the final values of the variables. Moreover,
                `options['rhoend']` should be no more than `options['rhobeg']` and is by default 1e-6.
            maxfev: int, optional
                Upper bound of the number of calls of the objective function `fun`. Its value must be not less than
                (n+1)*(n+2)/2+1. By default, it is 500*n.
            ftarget: float, optional
                Target value of the objective function. If an iterate achieves an objective function value lower or
                equal to `options['ftarget']`, the algorithm stops immediately. By default, it is -numpy.inf.
            quiet: bool, optional
                Flag of quietness of the interface. If it is set to True, the output message will not be printed. This
                flag does not interfere with the warning and error printing.
            classical: bool, optional
                Flag indicating whether to call the classical Powell code or not. By default, it is False.
            debug: bool, optional
                Debugging flag. By default, it is False.
            chkfunval: bool, optional
                Flag used when debugging. If both `options['debug']` and `options['chkfunval']` are True, an extra
                function evaluation would be performed to check whether the returned objective function value matches
                the returned x. By default, it is False.

    Returns
    -------
    res: OptimizeResult
        The results of the solver. Check ``pdfo.OptimizeResult`` for a description of the attributes.

    Notes
    -----
    The signature of this function is consistent with the `minimize` function available in ``scipy.optimize``, included
    in the SciPy package.

    See https://www.pdfo.net for more information.

    Examples
    --------
    1. The following code

    >>> from pdfo import *
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> options = {'maxfev': 50}
    >>> uobyqa(np.cos, -1, options=options)

    solves
        min  cos(x)
    starting from x0 = -1 with at most 50 function evaluations.

    2. The following code

    >>> from pdfo import *
    >>> obj = lambda x: x[0]**2 + x[1]**2
    >>> options = {'maxfev': 200}
    >>> uobyqa(obj, [0, 1], options=options)

    solves
        min  x^2 + y^2
    starting from [x0, y0] = [0, 1] with at most 200 function evaluations.
