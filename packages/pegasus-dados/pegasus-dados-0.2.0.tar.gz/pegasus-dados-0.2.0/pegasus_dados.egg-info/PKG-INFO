Description: 
        The PegaSUS project is divided into n modules. One of the implemented modules,
        called dados, allows to create a schema of a PostgreSQL database, previously
        created in the user computer, and to insert data that belongs to the following
        information health systems of the Brazilian Public Health System (SUS): CNES,
        SIH, SIA, SIM, SINASC or SINAN (more to come). The dados module also also allows
        to directly read main data files (in DBC format) and auxiliary data files (in
        DBF or CNV format) as pandas DataFrame objects. This second option is recommended
        in the case of more punctual consultation.
        
        To use the dados module by means of a PostgreSQL database it is necessary to
        install the PostgreSQL DBMS (https://www.postgresql.org/download/) and it is
        recommended to have a database management software such as pgAdmin (https://www.pgadmin.org/download/)
        or DBeaver Community (https://dbeaver.io/), to proper visualize the structured
        data.
        
        To use the dados module on Linux or MacOS platforms it is necessary to install
        the libffi dependency:
        1) Linux: `$ sudo apt install libffi-dev`
        2) MacOS: `$ brew install libffi`
        
        For use on Windows platforms it is necessary to install the executable program
        (*.exe*) dbf2dbc, which is part of the Datasus Tabwin program. To accomplish this,
        download the "Tab415.zip" folder by selecting the eponymous link contained in the
        first line of the "Name" column of the table that appears in http://www2.datasus.gov.br/DATASUS/index.php?area=060805&item=3.
        Unpack the "Tab415.zip" folder, copy the executable "dbf2dbc.exe" and the file
        "IMPBORL.DLL" (the unpacked folder "Tab415" and its *.zip* can be deleted) to a
        newly created folder named "dbf2dbc" in the root directory of the user's computer,
        which generally has the following form on Windows platforms:
        
        ```C:\```
        
        Finally, the data module is installed using the command(on Linux platforms):
        
        ```$ sudo pip install pegasus-dados```
