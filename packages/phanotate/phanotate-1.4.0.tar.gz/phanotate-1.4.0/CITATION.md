# Citing Phanotate

If you use phanotate, please cite this paper:

```text
McNair K, Zhou C, Souza B, Edwards R. 2018. THEA: A novel approach to gene identification in phage genomes. bioRxiv.
```

We are working improving that paper and will have a new version soon. We hope to have the peer reviewed version published too, so a full citation will follow.
