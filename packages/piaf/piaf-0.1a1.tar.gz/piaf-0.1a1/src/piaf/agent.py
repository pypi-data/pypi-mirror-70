The :mod:`piaf.agent` module contains everything you need to create your own agents.

According to FIPA specification:

.. epigraph::

    "An agent is a computational process that implements the autonomous, communicating
    functionality of an application. Agents communicate using an Agent Communication
    Language. An Agent is the fundamental actor on an [Agent Platform] which combines
    one or more service capabilities, as published in a service description, into a
    unified and integrated execution model. An agent must have at least one owner, for
    example, based on organisational affiliation or human user ownership, and an agent
    must support at least one notion of identity. This notion of identity is the Agent
    Identifier (AID) that labels an agent so that it  may be distinguished unambiguously
    within the Agent Universe. An agent may be registered at a number of transport
    addresses at which it can be contacted."

    -- `FIPA000023 <http://www.fipa.org/specs/fipa00023/SC00023K.html#_Toc75950978>`_

Currently, the Agent API supports:

* Communication with other Agents
* Agent IDentifier
* Multi transport addresses

It doesn't support:

* Agent ownership

class Agent:

    :class:`Agent` is the base class for all user agents.

    When creating an agent, you must provide this agent's identity and the platform
    facade that it will use to access vital functionalities like querying / updating
    the agent's state or communicating with other agents.

    You can use this class directly although your agent will be useless. We recommend
    subclassing.

    When subclassing the :class:`Agent` class, you can safely:

    * Extend the constructor to add new instructions
    * Extend all methods except the :meth: `run` method
    * Add custom methods
