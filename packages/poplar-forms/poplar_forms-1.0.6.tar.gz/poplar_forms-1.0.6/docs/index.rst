The Poplar Forms package, and accompanying PPFORMS module, are used to 
integrate Orchid Extender's Workflow for Sage 300 with fleetingforms.io
to securely collect well formatted, validated, data from users or 
customers from beyond the corporate perimeter.

The package contains `Workflow actions`_ for Orchid Extender that make it 
simple to create an approval form that can be completed from any computer,
phone, or tablet connected to the internet.
