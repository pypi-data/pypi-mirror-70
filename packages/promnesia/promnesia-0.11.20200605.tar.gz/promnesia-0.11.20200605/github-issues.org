: At the moment the algorithm is very basic and not super reliable.
: 
: Tried using [diff-match-patch](https://github.com/google/diff-match-patch), but it was quite awkward. Doesn't seem to support patterns longer than 32 bits? 
: I think Hypothes.is is using it for highlights, but they have modified it?

: E.g. search history per se is not useful perhaps, but having it around is quite convenient as a means of answering 'How did I get on this page?'.

:END:
: Perhaps easy to get away with simply using grep.
: But if there is a some generic tool to extract comments from common source code formats, why not use it?

: Sadly, mobile Chrome doesn't support browser extensions, so bookmarklet is the only way to implement it?
: Although kind of defeats the purpose of being notified automatically.

: It's possible to change it in settings, but might be useful to make it possible to stretch it with mouse and make site dependent?

** OPEN Find a way to disable extensions on security critical websites (e.g. banks)
:PROPERTIES:
:tags:     ("enhancement" "security")
:id:       2

:date-creation: 2019-07-14T14:23:44+0100
:author:   "karlicoss"
:END:
: Since extension is sending urls to the backend, it's potentially not secure to do so on websites like banks. While extension supports blacklisting it's not really great to rely on user to do so.
: 
: Perhaps some of these lists https://github.com/cbuijs/shallalist would be a good start, unclear how often is it updated though. 
: 
: Also need to add a UI explanation if the link is blacklisted; and an option to whitelist urls from the 'default' lists in case user really really wants it.

** OPEN handle multiple browser windows

:END:
: E.g. something inotify based. That would make the implementation quite a bit more complext that it's at the moment.
: Also due to the nature of many exports (periodic), it won't be realtime unless the underlying exports are realtime.
: Still it could at least detect source files changes, etc.
: Also would work well in conjunction with Grasp.

** OPEN better interface for jumping from highlight straight to the sidebar context
:PROPERTIES:
:tags:     ("ui")

:author:   "karlicoss"
:END:
: E.g. it might be reasonable to display original timezone that comes from the backend instead of converting into local timezone? 
: It impacts 'collapsing' logic (when close timestamps converted in a range), also local browser history doesn't know your past timezone. But perhaps it's a minor.

:END:
: I've had to write `check_call(['systemctl', ...])` and use templating for systemd services more than I wish I had.
: Can it be resolved in a more generic way?
