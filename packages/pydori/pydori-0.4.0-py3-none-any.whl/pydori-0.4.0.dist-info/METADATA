# Pydori



[![PyPI version fury.io](https://badge.fury.io/py/pydori.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pydori/)



A python wrapper for the bandori.party and bandori.ga public APIs.



# Info
Although both bandori.party and bandori database provide extensive public bang dream api's, there is currently not much documentation to help navigate through them. This package attempts to simplify accessing the various endpoints they provide. Not everything is available through this package, but the main ones should be here. This package consolidates both the bandori.party and bandori.ga APIs - for example, songs are not available through the bandori.party API, so all music-related data is gotten from bandori database.


# Installation

Use pip to install:

``` pip install pydori ```



# Example
This example instantiates a BandoriApi object, gets a card by ID, and displays the card's name.
```python
import pydori

b = pydori.BandoriApi()
result = b.get_cards(id=[511])
card = result[0]

print(card.name)
```

Here we get the current event and display the start and end times:
```python
from pydori import BandoriApi as api

b = api()
current = b.get_current_event()[0]

print(current.get_start_date())
print(current.get_end_date())
```

# Documentation

## BandoriApi
 ```pydori.BandoriApi(region = 'en/')```

A class that talks to the bandori APIs. All functions that should be used are in this class. It holds the following attributes:

- **URL_PARTY** - A url to the bandori.party api

- **URL_GA** - a url to the bandori.ga api

- **URL_GA_RES** - a url to the bandori database resource api

### Parameters
- region(Optional[str]) - Region used for the bandori database api. Other options include 'jp/', 'tw/' (not tested), 'kr/' (not tested)

### Functions
#### ```get_cards(id : list = [])```
Returns a list of ```Card``` objects based on the ids provided. If the list is empty, all cards will be returned.

#### ```get_members(id : list = [])```
Returns a list of ```Member``` objects based on the ids provided. If the list is empty, all members will be returned.

#### ```get_events(id : list = [])```
Returns a list of ```Event``` objects based on the ids provided. If the list is empty, all members will be returned.

#### ```get_current_event()```
Returns the current event as an ```Event``` object in a list (it makes an internal call to ```get_events```). The current event is provided by the bandori database api, but the event data itself is from bandori.party.

#### ```get_costumes(id : list = [])```
Returns a list of ```Costume``` objects based on the ids provided. If the list is empty, all costumes will be returned.

#### ```get_items(id : list = [])```
Returns a list of ```Item``` objects based on the ids provided. If the list is empty, all items will be returned.

#### ```get_areaitems(id : list = [])```
Returns a list of ```AreaItem``` objects based on the ids provided. If the list is empty, all areaitems will be returned.

#### ```get_assets(id : list = [])```
Returns a dict where the keys are the different subtypes of ```Asset```, and the values are a list of those objects. If the input list is empty, all assets will be returned.

Even when there is only one asset queried, a full dict will be returned - just with empty lists in some of the values.


#### ```get_bands()```
Returns a list of all bands as ```Band``` objects. You cannot get a specific band from id. This is region sensitive.

#### ```get_songs(id : list = [])```
Returns a list of ```Song``` objects based on the ids provided. If the list is empty, all songs will be returned. This is region sensitive.

#### ```get_gachas(id : list = [])```
Returns a list of ```Gacha```objects based on the ids provided. If the list is empty, all gachas will be returned. This is region sensitive.


## BandoriObject
```pydori.base_objects.BandoriObject(data : dict, id_name = 'id', region = 'en/')```

Bandori objects are classes that represent data retrieved from the api. They are used to have quick access to certain attributes, and provide helpful methods on the data. They can be sorted by id. **They should not be normally instantiated (unless for debugging) and are meant as outputs from BandoriApi.** All BandoriObjects have the follow attributes:

- **URL_PARTY** - A url to the bandori.party api

- **URL_GA** - a url to the bandori.ga api

- **URL_GA_RES** - a url to the bandori database resource api


- **id** - The object's id

- **data** - The original dict of the object's information from the api.


_Notes:_

*Region select only works on certain methods - Song, Gacha, Band. See below*

*Not all attributes available from the api are recorded when creating these objects. It's best to work with the **data** dict as it contains everything.*

*Some attributes may have a null value and not work with their intended functions. Check before using.*

*The bandori.party api is used for most classes. The Songs, Bands, and Gachas class make use of the bandori database api.*

### Parameters
- data([dict]) - A python dictionary containing the data for the class

- id_name(Optional[str]) - The string to use when searching for the id in the dict.

- region(Optional[str]) - Region used for the bandori database api. Other options include 'jp/', 'tw/' (not tested), 'kr/' (not tested)
