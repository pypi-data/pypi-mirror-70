Ground motion models implemented in Python.

I have recently learned that additional ground motion models have been implemented through GEM's OpenQuake Hazardlib_, which I recommend checking out.

.. _Hazardlib: https://github.com/gem/oq-hazardlib

Features
--------

Models currently supported:

* Akkar, Sandikkaya, & Bommer (2014) with unit tests

* Atkinson & Boore (2006)

* Abrahamson, Silva, & Kamai (2014) with unit tests

* Abrahamson, Gregor, & Addo (2016) with unit tests

* Boore, Stewart, Seyhan, & Atkinson (2014) with unit tests

* Campbell (2003)

* Campbell & Bozorgnia (2014) with unit tests

* Chiou & Youngs (2014) with unit tests

* Derras, Bard & Cotton (2013) with unit tests

* Idriss (2014) with unit tests

* Pezeshk, Zandieh, & Tavakoli (2001)

* Tavakoli & Pezeshk (2005)

Conditional spectra models:

* Baker & Jayaram (2008) with unit tests

* Kishida (2017) with unit tests

Unit tests means that each test cases are used to test the implemention of
the model.
