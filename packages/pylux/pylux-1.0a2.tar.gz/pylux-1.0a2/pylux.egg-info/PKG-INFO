Description: Pylux
        =====
        
        Pylux is a program for creating and managing documentation for stage lighting.
        
        Pylux currently has the capability to generate plaintext documentation from
        Jinja template files and create 2D plots in SVG although you will need to provide 
        your own fixture vector files.
        
        You can also import data from an Eos ASCII export, including the complete patch,
        groups, palettes, and cues.
        
        Installation and Dependencies
        -----------------------------
        Pylux is available on PyPI, so after installing Python and pip, you can simply run::
        
            pip3 install pylux
        
        The PyPI package does not include the content repository, which includes fixture
        templates, symbols and documentation templates. Pylux will search in ``~/.pylux``
        for this, so you can just clone the repository there::
        
            git clone https://github.com/jackdpage/pylux-content.git ~/.pylux
        
        Simply run ``pylux`` from the terminal to launch the program.
