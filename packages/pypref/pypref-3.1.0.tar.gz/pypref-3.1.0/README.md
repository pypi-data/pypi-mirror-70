# pypref
PYthon PREFrences or pypref is a python implementation to creating application's 
preferences file and dynamically interacting, updating and pulling preferences. 
Most applications have default settings and preferences and in general those are 
created and stored in a text file. At some point preferences are pulled and updated
by the application and the users.
pypref is especially designed to take care of this task automatically and make programing
application's preferences more desirable.
