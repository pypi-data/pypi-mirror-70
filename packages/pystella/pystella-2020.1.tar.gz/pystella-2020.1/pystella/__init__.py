    A wrapper to choose a device and create a :class:`pyopencl.Context` on

        :class:`list` returned by :func:`pyopencl.get_platforms` to choose.
        Defaults to *None*, in which case a NVIDIA platform.

        Defaults to *None*, in which case a device is chosen according to any

        Currently only looks for OpenMPI and MVAPICH environment variables.
