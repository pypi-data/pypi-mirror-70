# StoNED-Python

`StoNED-Python` project provides the python codes for estimating Convex Nonparametric Least Square (`CNLS`), Stochastic Nonparametric Envelopment of Data (`StoNED`), and other different `StoNED`-related variants. It allows the user to estimate the CNLS/StoNED models in an open-access environment rather than in commercial software, e.g., GAMS, MATLAB. The `StoNED-Python` project is built based on the [PYOMO](http://www.pyomo.org/). 

# Installation

We have published a beta version [`pyStoNED`](https://pypi.org/project/pystoned/) package on PyPI. Please feel free to download and test it. We welcome any bug reports and feedback.
