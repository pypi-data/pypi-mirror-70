Whenever an exception has been raised in a `with reraise` block since the last call, it will by raised on the next call.\n\n### Multiple Exceptions\n\nWhen the `reraise` context manager is used multiple times in a single test case, only the first-raised exception will be re-raised in the end.\nIn the below example, both threads raise an exception but only one of these exceptions will be re-raised.\n\n```python\ndef test_assert(reraise):\n\n    def run():\n        with reraise:\n            assert False\n\n    for _ in range(2):\n        Thread(target=run).start()\n```\n\n### Catching Exceptions\n\nBy default, the `reraise` context manager does not catch exceptions, so they will not be hidden from the thread in which they are raised.\nIf you want to change this, use `reraise(catch=True)` instead of `reraise`:\n\n```python\ndef test_assert(reraise):\n\n    def run():\n        with reraise(catch=True):\n            assert False\n        print("I\'m alive!")\n\n    Thread(target=run).start()\n```\n\nNote that you cannot use `reraise()` (without the `catch` argument) as a context manager, as it is used to raise exceptions.\n\n### Exception Priority\n\nIf `reraise` captures an exception and the main thread raises an exception as well, the exception captured by `reraise` will mask the main thread\'s exception unless that exception was already re-raised.\nThe objective behind this is that the outcome of the main thread often depends on the work performed in other threads.\nThus, failures in in other threads are likely to cause failures in the main thread, and other threads\' exceptions (if any) are of greater importance for the developer than main thread exceptions.\n\nThe example below will report `assert False`, not `assert "foo" == "bar"`.\n\n```python\ndef test_assert(reraise):\n\n    def run():\n        with reraise:\n            assert False # This will be reported\n\n    t = Thread(target=run)\n    t.start()\n    t.join()\n\n    assert "foo" == "bar" # This won\'t\n```\n\n### Accessing and Modifying Exceptions\n\n`reraise` provides an `exception` property to retrieve the exception that was captured, if any.\n`reraise.exception` can also be used to assign an exception if no exception has been captured yet.\nIn addition to that, `reraise.reset()` returns the value of `reraise.exception` and resets it to `None` so that the exception will not be raised anymore.\n\nHere\'s a quick demonstration test case that passes:\n\n```python\ndef test_assert(reraise):\n\n    def run():\n        with reraise:\n            assert False\n\n    t = Thread(target=run)\n    t.start()\n    t.join()\n\n    # Return the captured exception:\n    assert type(reraise.exception) is AssertionError\n\n    # This won\'t do anything, since an exception has already been captured:\n    reraise.exception = Exception()\n\n    # Return the exception and set `reraise.exception` to None:\n    assert type(reraise.reset()) is AssertionError\n\n    # `Reraise` will not fail the test case because\n    assert reraise.exception is None\n```\n',
