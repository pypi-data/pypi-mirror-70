An open source Python wrapper for the `Unsplash REST API <https://unsplash.com/developers>`_.
The source code is available on GitHub at `https://github.com/salvoventura/pyunsplash <https://github.com/salvoventura/pyunsplash>`_.


############
Installation
############
``PyUnsplash`` is available on `PyPI <https://pypi.python.org/pypi>`_ and thus can be installed with ``pip`` on most platforms.
::

    $ pip install pyunsplash

############
Dependencies
############
This library depends on `Requests <http://docs.python-requests.org>`_ to make - well - requests to the Unsplash API.
This additional package should be automatically installed at installation time, or you can simply install it by:
::

    $ pip install requests

########
Examples
########
This example shows how the interaction with the paging functionality of the unsplash API is greatly abstracted and
simplified. The code below will iterate through all collections, and retrieve each photo in there, and print their
download link.

.. code-block:: python

    import logging
    from pyunsplash import PyUnsplash
    api_key = 'YOUR_APPLICATION_ID'

    # instantiate PyUnsplash object
    py_un = PyUnsplash(api_key=api_key)

    # pyunsplash logger defaults to level logging.ERROR
    # If you need to change that, use getLogger/setLevel
    # on the module logger, like this:
    logging.getLogger("pyunsplash").setLevel(logging.DEBUG)

    # Start with the generic collection, maximize number of items
    # note: this will run until all photos of all collections have
    #       been visited, unless a connection error occurs.
    #       Typically the API hourly limit gets hit during this
    #
    collections = py_un.collections(per_page=30)
    while collections.has_next:
        for collection in collections.entries:
            photos = collection.photos()
            for photo in photos.entries:
                print collection.title, photo.link_download, photo.get_attribution()

        # no need to specify per_page: will take from original object
        collections = collections.get_next_page()

**PyUnsplash v1.0.0a3 (alpha, v3)**

    v1.0.0a2 broke the library with the attempt to import the build number from Travis via the environment variable,
    which obviously vanishes outside of the CI system. Fixed. Will need a different solution if I really want/need
    build numbering inside the library version number.

    **Todo**
        Still struggling to get `PyPI <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyunsplash/>`_ publishing automated via
        `Travis-Ci <https://travis-ci.org/salvoventura/pyunsplash/>`_ after tag commits.

--------

**PyUnsplash v1.0.0a2 (alpha, v2)**

    Added support and integration for more tools, which also required some code cleanup:

    - integrate and run automated unit tests
    - integrate with CodeCov
    - integrate with CodeClimate

    **Todo**
        Still struggling to get PyPI publishing automated via Travis-Ci after tag commits.

--------

**PyUnsplash v1.0.0a1 (alpha, v1)**

    This first release offers read-only capabilities to the `Unsplash REST API <https://unsplash.com/documentation/>`_.
    Although with this limitation, I thought it would be useful to start exposing the library and collect
    feedback from the community early on.

    Features that are right now on my TODO list:

    - Authorization workflow & Current user
    - Write operations

    Desired:
        - More unit-test coverage
        - Documentation review
