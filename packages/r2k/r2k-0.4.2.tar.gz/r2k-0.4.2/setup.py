    'long_description': '# R2K (RSS to Kindle)\n\nA tool that lets you periodically send articles received from an RSS feed to your Kindle.\n`r2k` allows you to track your favorite RSS/Atom feeds, and send cleaned versions of them to your\nKindle.\n\nIt currently does this by sending you email messages through the \n[PushToKindle](http://pushtokindle.com/) service. The service cleans up the articles, removing any\nads and fluff, and you\'re left with only the text and images.\n\nFuture releases are likely to include alternatives to using PushToKindle. The first such plugin\nwill use a dockerized version of the [Mercury-Parser](https://github.com/postlight/mercury-parser).  \n\n[Installation](#installation)\n[Usage](#usage)\n\n## Installation\nIf you are using Poetry, add `r2k` to your `pyproject.toml` file by using:\n```bash\npoetry add r2k\n```\n\nIf not, you can use `pip`:\n\n```\npip install r2k\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n### Preparations\n\n#### If you\'re using PushToKindle (PTK)\n\nThe free version of PTK only allows for 25 articles to be sent using their service. After this,\nyou\'ll have to become their "sustainer" (for as low as 1$/month) on Patreon \n[here](https://www.patreon.com/bePatron?c=1946606).\n\nBefore using `r2k` with PTK you need to:\n\n1. Know your kindle email address (find it [here](https://www.amazon.com/mycd), under \n"Preferences" -> "Personal Document Settings").\n\n2. Add `kindle@fivefilters.org` to the list of approved email senders (in the same place in \nAmazon\'s settings).\n\n### Set up your configuration file\n\nMost of what `r2k` does involves the configuration file, in which the feeds you\'re subscribed to\nare kept, as well as some other data.\n\nAfter installation, run:\n\n```bash\nr2k config init [-p CONFIG_PATH] \n```\n\nThe default location for the config YAML file is in `~/.r2k/config.yml`.\n\nDuring the init you\'ll be asked several questions (like your kindle email address).\n\nTo see your configuration run:\n\n```bash\nr2k config show [-p CONFIG_PATH]\n```\n\n### Add some RSS subscriptions\n\n#### Using an OPML file\n\nThe [OPML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPML) format is widely used in the RSS/Atom world \n(as well as in podcasting and other areas) to represent a collection of feeds. You can export your \nexisting subscriptions from most feed readers into an OPML file.\n\nTo load all of your subscriptions in one move run:\n\n```bash\nr2k feed import PATH_TO_OPML_FILE\n```\n\n#### Manually adding feeds\n\nIf you don\'t have an OPML export, or just want to add a single feed you can run:\n\n```bash\nr2k feed add -t FEED_TITLE -u FEED_URL\n```\n\nIf the `FEED_URL` is a proper RSS feed (i.e. an actual XML feed URL), it will be added as is.\nIf the `FEED_URL` is a regular URL, `r2k` will attempt to find the RSS feed by analyzing the page\nsource. In the case of multiple candidates (e.g. WordPress content feed and comment feed), you will\nbe presented with a list of choices.\n\n### Send updates to your Kindle\n\nRight now the "periodical" part of `r2k` is not yet operational. In order to send updates to your\nKindle you\'ll have to run:\n\n```bash\nr2k kindle send [-f FEED_TITLE]\n```\n\nIf you don\'t pass the `-f/--feed-title` option, updates will be sent for all of your subscriptions.\n\nThe first time that `kindle send` is run for any feed, you will be presented with a list of all the \navailable articles in the feed (note that RSS feeds usually only keep a subset of the most recent\nentries), and will be asked to choose the last one you\'ve already read. This is to avoiding sending\nyou any article you\'ve already consumed.\n ',
