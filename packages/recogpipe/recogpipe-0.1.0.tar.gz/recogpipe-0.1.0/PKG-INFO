Description: # DeepSpeech as a (Docker) Service for IBus
        
        This repository includes the following:
        
        * a Docker container that can run DeepSpeech hardware-accelerated by your
          host OS's (nVidia) graphics card; the container reads audio from a pipe and
          reports results to an event
        * an IBus Engine that allows the reslts of the recognition to be treated as
          regular input to the (Linux) host operating system
        
        ## Installation/Setup
        
        ```
        git clone https://github.com/mcfletch/deepspeech-docker.git
        cd deepspeech-docker
        ```
        Starting the daemon in a docker container:
        ```
        ./recogpipe/dockersetup.py
        # when docker container is started...
        ./recogpipe/daemon.py
        ```
        Feeding some data into the daemon from your microphone:
        ```
        ffmpeg-audio.sh 
        ```
        Feeding some data into the daemon from a wav file:
        ```
        ffmpeg-sample.sh path/to/your/file.wav
        ```
        Running the IBus daemon on your desktop:
        ```
        ./recogpipe/ibusengine.py
        ```
        
        
        ## Testing bits out...
        
        Sending audio to the daemon
        ```
        ./ffmpeg-audio.sh hw:1,1
        ./ffmpeg-sample.sh /path/to/some.wav
        ```
        Viewing the raw transcripts from the daemon
        ```
        nc -U /tmp/dspipe/events
        ```
        Running the ibus engine interactively:
        ```
        ./ibusengine.py
        ```
