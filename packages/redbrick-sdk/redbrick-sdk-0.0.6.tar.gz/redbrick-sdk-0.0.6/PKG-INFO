Description: # Introduction
        
        This is an SDK to make integrating with the RedBrick platform as easy as possible. This includes uploading and downloading data
        as well as making your datasets easily available for training.
        
        
        Desired behaviors:
        * Upload:
            - upload a folder of images to a redbrick dataset
        
        * download:
            - download images from redbrick, save as .jpg/.png or numpy arrays
            - download labels and save to specific file formats:
                - Coco format
                - darknet training format
        
        * training:
            - Data in vectorized format ready to be converted to
        
        
        ## Quickstart
        
        After creating an account on app.redbrickai.com
        
        ```bash
        pip install redbrick-sdk
        ```
        
        ```python
        import redbrick
        import torchvision
        
        # Setup Redbrick Global context
        client = redbrick.client(org_id="asdasd", api_key="asdasd")
        
        # create a prelabeler instance
        prelabeler = redbrick.prelabeling(project_id="project_id", stage_name="stage_name")
        
        # show an example image
        prelabeler.show_sample()
        
        # import a model
        model = torchvision.models.detection.fasterrcnn_resnet50_fpn(pretrained=True)
        model.eval()
        
        # run inference and upload predictions to redbrick
        
        
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        ```python
