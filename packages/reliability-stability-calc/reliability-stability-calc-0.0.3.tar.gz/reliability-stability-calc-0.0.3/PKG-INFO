Description: # Reliability Stability
        
        ## Description
        
        reliability-stability is a simple python package, which takes a csv or other pandas compatable data file and gives the reliability and stability of three columns for test-retest reliability and stability.

        The reliability and stability calculations, as well as an assumption test, are based on the 1969 paper from Heise, D. R. ['Separating Reliability and Stability in Test-Retest Correlation'](https://doi.org/10.2307/2092790).
        
        ## Installation
        
        pip install reliability stability:
        
        ```
        >>> pip install reliability-stability-calc
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        reliability stability is a python package with fuctions defined to: 
        1. calculate correlation between two data columns (calc_correlation)
        2. calculate the test-retest reliability between three data columns (calc_reliability)
        3. calculate the test-retest stability between three data columns (calc_stability)
        4. perform an assumption test with a fourth column (assumption_test)
        5. implement a bootstap test to test assumptions (bootstrap_assumption_test)
