Removinator
===========

A library for controlling the Smart Card Removinator device.

The Smart Card Removinator is a hardware device designed for automation of
smart card testing with physical tokens. Testing with physical tokens often
requires smart cards to by removed and inserted from the card reader to trigger
things like screen locking, or simply to test multiple models of tokens or with
different certificates. The Smart Card Removinator electronically switches the
card that is connected to a reader from a bank of cards in response to commands
issued to it over a serial interface.

The removinator library provides a convenient way of interfacing with the
serial interface of the Smart Card Removinator from Python programs.
