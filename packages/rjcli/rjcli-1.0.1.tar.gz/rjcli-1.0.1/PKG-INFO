Description: # rjcli for Dell EMC PowerProtect Data Manager
        
        A command line interface developed for Dell EMC Power Protect Data Manager (PPDM). PPDM is a Dell EMC's modern data center backup and recovery software which is developed based on microservices architecture.
        It has a user friendly and modern interface to configure, manage and monitor backups. PPDM has a RestAPI for the customers to integrate backups into their DevOps pipeline or for other automation purpose.
        I have developed this CLI to provide some of the funcitionalies through a command line for the customers who wish to use CLI.
        
        This CLI has features like to list activities, storage, policies, assets and also will be able to retry failed jobs.
        This is a version 1.0 CLI, i will be adding more features in the future.
