Description: # pyrust-keyring
        A C-level conversion to Python (cpython) of the Rust keyring crate by hwchen (https://github.com/hwchen/keyring-rs).
        
        # Motivation
        Since using _pypi.org_ keyring library to store sensitive data with the PyInstaller library  
        isn't possible at the moment due to the error `keyring.errors.NoKeyringError` and since   
        it has been like this for a long time now, I've decided to try to port the Rust programming language  
        keyring library (as I'm still learning it) to Python and been able to do so successfully.
        
        Tested successfully on Windows 10 to work with PyInstaller.
        
        # Usage
        
        ## Store Password
        ```python
        import rskeyring
        from getpass import getpass
        
        username = input("Username: ")
        password = getpass()
        
        rskeyring.set_password("service", username, password)
        ```
        
        ## Retrieve Password
        ```python
        import rskeyring
        
        username = input("Username: ")
        password = rskeyring.get_password("service", username)
        
        print(password)
        ```
        
        # Compile
        In order to compile the Rust code, you'll need to have the `rustup` toolchain.  
        To install the `rustup` toolchain, go to https://rustup.rs
        
        From within this directory, execute the next command to compile:  
        `cargo build --release`
        
        # Use Compiled Library
        
        ## Windows
        Copy the file `pyrust-keyring\target\release\rskeyring.dll` to your Python project. Make sure you rename its extension from `.dll` to `.pyd`.
        
        ## MacOS
        Copy the file `pyrust-keyring/target/release/rskeyring.dylib` to your Python project. Make sure you rename its extension from `.dylib` to `.so`.
