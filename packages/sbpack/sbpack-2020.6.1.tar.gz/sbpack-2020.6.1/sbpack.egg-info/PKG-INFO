Description: # sbpack
        
        ![](https://github.com/rabix/sbpack/workflows/Tests/badge.svg)
        
        Upload CWL apps to any Seven Bridges powered platform. Resolves linked processes, schemadefs and `$include`s and
         `$import`s.
        
        ## Installation
        
        (It is good practice to install Python programs in a virtual environment. [pipx] is a very effective tool for
         installing command line Python tools in isolated environments)
        
        [pipx]: https://github.com/pipxproject/pipx
        
        `sbpack` needs Python 3.6 or later
        
        ```
        pip3 install pipx  # in case you don't have pipx
        pipx ensurepath # ensures CLI application directory is on your $PATH
        pipx install git+https://github.com/kaushik-work/sbpack.git
        # use pipx upgrade ... if upgrading an existing install
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        ```
        Usage
           sbpack <profile> <id> <cwl>
         
        where:
          <profile> refers to a SB platform profile as set in the SB API credentials file.
          <id> takes the form {user}/{project}/{app_id} which installs (or updates) 
               "app_id" located in "project" of "user".
          <cwl> is the path to the main CWL file to be uploaded. This can be a remote file.
        ```
         
        ## Uploading workflows defined remotely
        
        `sbpack` handles local paths and remote URLs in a principled manner. This means that
        `sbpack` will handle packing and uploading a local workflow that links to a remote workflow
        which itself has linked workflows. It will therefore also handle packing a fully 
        remote workflow.
        
        For example, to pack and upload the workflow located at `https://github.com/Duke-GCB/GGR-cwl/blob/master/v1.0/ATAC-seq_pipeline/pipeline-se.cwl`
        go to the `raw` button and use that URL, like:
        
        ```bash
        sbpack sbg kghosesbg/sbpla-31744/ATAC-seq-pipeline-se https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Duke-GCB/GGR-cwl/master/v1.0/ATAC-seq_pipeline/pipeline-se.cwl
        ``` 
        
        ## Local packing
        ```
        Usage
            cwlpack <cwl> > packed.cwl
        ```
        
        The `cwlpack` utility allows you to pack a workflow and print it out on `stdout` instead of 
        uploading it to a SB platform.
        
        
        ## Credentials file and profiles
        
        If you use the SBG API you already have an API configuration file. If
        not, you should create one. It is located in 
        `~/.sevenbridges/credentials`. ([Documentation][cred-doc])
        
        [cred-doc]: https://docs.sevenbridges.com/docs/store-credentials-to-access-seven-bridges-client-applications-and-libraries
        
        Briefly, each section in the SBG configuration file (e.g. `[cgc]`) is a 
        profile name and has two entries. The end-point and an authentication
        token, which you get from your developer tab on the platform.
        
        ```
        [sbg-us]
        api_endpoint = https://api.sbgenomics.com/v2
        auth_token   = <dev token here>
        
        [sbg-eu]
        api_endpoint = https://eu-api.sbgenomics.com/v2
        auth_token   = <dev token here>
        
        [sbg-china]
        api_endpoint = https://api.sevenbridges.cn/v2
        auth_token   = <dev token here>
        
        [cgc]
        api_endpoint = https://cgc-api.sbgenomics.com/v2
        auth_token   = <dev token here>
        
        [cavatica]
        api_endpoint = https://cavatica-api.sbgenomics.com/v2
        auth_token   = <dev token here>
        
        [nhlbi]
        api_endpoint = https://api.sb.biodatacatalyst.nhlbi.nih.gov/v2
        auth_token   = <dev token here>
        ```
        
        You can have several profiles on the same platform if, for example, you 
        are an enterprise user and you belong to several divisions. Please refer
        to the API documentation for more detail.
