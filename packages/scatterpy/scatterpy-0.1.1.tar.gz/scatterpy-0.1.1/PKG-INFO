Description: Python module to calculate scattering amplitude and phase matrices of
        rotationally symmetric particles based on the T-matrix method.
        
        Based on the original Fortran T-matrix code by M.I. Mishchenko. (https://www.giss.nasa.gov/staff/mmishchenko/t_matrix.html). Includes orientation averaging schemes adapted from J. Leinonen (https://github.com/jleinonen/pytmatrix).
        
        This is a pure Python reimplementation of the original routines using NumPy, not a Python wrapper around the Fortran code.
        
        Currently spheroids, Chebyshev shapes and generalized chebyshev shapes are
        implemented. Also includes several empirical raindrop shapes.
