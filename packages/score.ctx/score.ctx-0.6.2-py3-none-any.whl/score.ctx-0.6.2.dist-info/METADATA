score.ctx
=========

Every single interaction with an application is strongly tied to an
environment, where the interaction is taking place. There is probably an
authenticated user, a running database transaction, connections to remote
servers, etc.

This module provides a framework for defining the parameters of these
environments, allowing other modules to provide valuable information relevant
to the current interaction.

The `narrative documentation of score.ctx`__ contains all the information you
need to put this module to good use.
