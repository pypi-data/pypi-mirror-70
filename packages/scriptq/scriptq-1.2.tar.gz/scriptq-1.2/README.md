You can add more scripts to the queue, as well as edit the content and order of added scripts as you go.

Optional: setting up email notifications
----------------------------------------

ScriptQ can optionally send an email to one or multiple addresses when a script ends.
This email will contain the script path, the status with which the script ended (success or failure), and the output that the script would print in a command prompt.

**How to set this up?**

 - [Create a gmail address](https://accounts.google.com/signup/v2/webcreateaccount?flowName=GlifWebSignIn&flowEntry=SignUp
) from which ScriptQ will send the emails
 - Allow "less secure" apps to access that gmail account. Log in to your newly created gmail account, head to [this link](https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps), and switch "Allow less secure apps" to ON. **Warning**: be very careful to not do this on your personal gmail account, I would recommend using an "incognito" window for this step.
 - Edit the ScriptQ settings file located at `python_directory\Lib\site-packages\scriptq\settings.py` as follows

```
gmail_notifications = {
    'enable' : True,
    'sender_email': "my_newly_created_address@gmail.com",
    'sender_password': "my_newly_created_password",
    'receiver_emails': ["alice@bla.com","bob@blob.net"]
}
```
