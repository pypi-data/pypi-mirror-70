Description: # Syllabelizer for Indonesian Language in Python
        This is a rule-based syllabelizer for Indonesian Language. Please note that this project does not aim to replicate rules in Ejaan yang Disempurnakan (EYD), but focuses on a simple way to split indonesian words into common sub-words because it is good enough for my purposes.
        
        ## Installation
        ```
        pip install silabel
        ```
        
        ## Example Usage
        ```python
        from silabel import Syllabelizer
        
        s = Syllabelizer()
        s.syllabelize("menggunakan") # ['meng', 'gu', 'na', 'kan']
        s.syllabelize("memperkirakan") # ['mem', 'per', 'ki', 'ra', 'kan']
        ```
        
        ## End notes :heart:
        There is no reference used in this project. I simply create a set of rules based on indonesian vocal, consonant, and diftong to syllabelize indonesian words.
        
        I made this repo for educational purposes so it might need further tweaking to reach production level. <br>
        Feel free to create an issue if you need help, and I hope I'll have the time to help you. Thank you.
