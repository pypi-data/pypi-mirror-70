        ## Benefits of simbak
        
        - Simbak uses tar and gzip in order to store the backups, so that recovering the data in backups does not depend on simbak itself.
        - Simbak is also very light, portable, and very easy to use, meaning that there's no large application to install.
        - It's free and open source, meaning anyone can contribute or change simbak to meet their own needs.
