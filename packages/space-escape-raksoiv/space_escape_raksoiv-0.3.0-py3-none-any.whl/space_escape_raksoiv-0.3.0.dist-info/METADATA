# Espace Escape

Space Escape is a 2D endless scroll game in which a spaceship will travel across an asteroid field. The player has the mission of control the space ship and avoid any danger that can impact the craft.

## Features

1. The spaceship has an inertia associated, so be careful when you want to perform a direction change.
1. The field will be denser and more challenging as further you go.
1. In the end, maybe you can find other life forms.

## Installation

Space Escape uses Python an easy to learn, powerful programming language. If you don't already have it, you can download it from [python.org](python.org). Python 3.7.7 or greater is required. For Windows users, please refer to [Python for Windows](https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html)

The best way to install Space Escape is with the [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) tool (which is what python uses to install packages). Note, this comes with python in recent versions. We use the --user flag to tell it to install into the home directory, rather than globally.

``` bash
python3 -m pip install -U space-escape-raksoiv --user
```


## Play the Game

To start the game write in whatever terminal o command line:

```bash
space-escape
```

## Starting Idea

This game starts from a tutorial of pygame https://realpython.com/pygame-a-primer/. In this tutorial, the student is encouraged to program a game about an airplane that needs to avoid rockets incoming. The first result of the game was precisely a spaceship that avoids asteroids, the change in the sprites of the game was due to a subscription to download the art pack.
So I take the sprites and arts from: https://opengameart.org/content/space-shooter-redux.

## A playable game

After the first success of a piece of code than can represent a game, the idea of doing this game playable was increasing in time. So I take the journey, from one script to a total game, starting from the menu of the game and give a player a score for his efforts to go across the field.

## Backlog

The next steps in the development process are:

1. High Score screen and persistent score history
1. Sound Effects
1. Power-Ups (Maybe)

Any feedback or idea is well received in the [issues](https://github.com/Raksoiv/space-escape/issues) section.

Happy Flying!
