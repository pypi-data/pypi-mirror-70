This file is part of spot-connect

Toolbox for launching an AWS spot instance: 

This package consists mainly of the boto3 functions that are used to request, 
launch and interact with a spot instance. These functions are used in the 
spot_connect.py script which can be launched from the command line or the 
spotted class which can be run from a notebook or python script
