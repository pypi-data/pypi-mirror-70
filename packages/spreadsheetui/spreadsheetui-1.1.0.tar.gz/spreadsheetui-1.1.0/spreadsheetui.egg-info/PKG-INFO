Description: ================================
        Spreadsheet UI
        ================================
        
        This is a web frontend that can combine multiple torrent clients into one.
        Designed for the power-user who wants an overview and manage existing torrents.
        
        The interface is based on ag-grid to provide stellar performance even with a large amount of torrents.
        As a plus it will also look a bit like a spreadsheet.

        .. code-block:: bash
        
            # Create a folder to put it all into
            mkdir spreadsheetui
            cd spreadsheetui
        
            # Download an example config file, remember to modify it
            curl -L -o config.toml https://github.com/JohnDoee/spreadsheetui/raw/master/config.toml.example
        
            curl -L -o docker-compose.yml https://github.com/JohnDoee/spreadsheetui/raw/master/docker-compose.yml
            docker-compose up -d
        
        
        Configuration
        --------------------------------
        
        Edit config.toml to fit your needs.
        
        Remember to change username, password. The secret_key should also be changed, anything random will do.
        
        You can add as many clients as you want, see the provided examples for syntax.
        
        When you are done and have started Spreadsheet UI, it is accessible on port 18816
        
        If you need to use a proxy layer to access your client (e.g. with Docker) `check out liltorrent <https://github.com/JohnDoee/libtc#liltorrent-usage>`_.
        
        Moving torrents
        --------------------------------
        
        For torrent moving to work, the `session_path` must be correct, `see more about session_path here <https://github.com/JohnDoee/libtc#session-path--fetching-torrents>`_
