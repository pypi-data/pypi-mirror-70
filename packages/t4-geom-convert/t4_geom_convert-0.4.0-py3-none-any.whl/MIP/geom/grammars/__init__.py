# To be able import semantics from modules here.

# For a grammar file named `xxx.ebnf`, corresponding module defining its
# semantics is `xxx.py`.

# Note that although this scheme is okay for testing, in general case another
# name pattern for semantics module could be more appropriate, to distinguish
# from the parser module, generated from `ebnf` by tatsu.
