Description: 
                usage: testflo [options]
        
                positional arguments:
                  test                  A test method, test case, module, or directory to run.
        
                optional arguments:
                  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
                  -c FILE, --config FILE
                                        Path of config file where preferences are specified.
                  -t FILE, --testfile FILE
                                        Path to a file containing one testspec per line.
                  --maxtime TIME_LIMIT  Specifies a time limit in seconds for tests to be
                                        saved to the quicktests.in file.
                  -n NUM_PROCS, --numprocs NUM_PROCS
                                        Number of processes to run. By default, this will use
                                        the number of CPUs available. To force serial
                                        execution, specify a value of 1.
                  -o FILE, --outfile FILE
                                        Name of test report file. Default is
                                        testflo_report.out.
                  -v, --verbose         Include testspec and elapsed time in screen output.
                                        Also shows all stderr output, even if test doesn't
                                        fail
                  --compact             Limit output to a single character for each test.
                  --dryrun              Don't actually run tests, but print which tests would
                                        have been run.
                  --pre_announce        Announce the name of each test before it runs. This
                                        can help track down a hanging test. This automatically
                                        sets -n 1.
                  -f, --fail            Save failed tests to failtests.in file.
                  --full_path           Display full test specs instead of shortened names.
                  -i, --isolated        Run each test in a separate subprocess.
                  --nompi               Force all tests to run without MPI. This can be useful
                                        for debugging.
                  -x, --stop            Stop after the first test failure, or as soon as
                                        possible when running concurrent tests.
                  -s, --nocapture       Standard output (stdout) will not be captured and will
                                        be written to the screen immediately.
                  --coverage            Perform coverage analysis and display results on
                                        stdout
                  --coverage-html       Perform coverage analysis and display results in
                                        browser
                  --coverpkg PKG        Add the given package to the coverage list. You can
                                        use this option multiple times to cover multiple
                                        packages.
                  --cover-omit FILE     Add a file name pattern to remove it from coverage.
                  -b, --benchmark       Specifies that benchmarks are to be run rather than
                                        tests, so only files starting with "benchmark\_" will
                                        be executed.
                  -d FILE, --datafile FILE
                                        Name of benchmark data file. Default is
                                        benchmark_data.csv.
                  --noreport            Don't create a test results file.
                  -m GLOB, --match GLOB, --testmatch GLOB
                                        Pattern to use for test discovery. Multiple patterns
                                        are allowed.
                  --timeout TIMEOUT     Timeout in seconds. Test will be terminated if it
                                        takes longer than timeout. Only works for tests
                                        running in a subprocess (MPI and isolated).
