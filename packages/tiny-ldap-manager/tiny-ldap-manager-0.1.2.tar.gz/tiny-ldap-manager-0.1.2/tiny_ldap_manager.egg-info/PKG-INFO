Description: # Tiny LDAP Manager
        This CLI tool allows you to easily perform basic operations (changes) on your
        LDAP server. It's aimed to ease these kind of tasks, without having to, necessarily,
        deal with *LDIF* files. Moreover, it permits you to do some of these things, in bulk!.
        
        ## Features
        More precisely, this program, allows you to:
         * Modify LDAP attributes (*replace*, *add* and *delete* modes, are supported!).
         * Delete LDAP entries. 
         * Add LDAP entries with their corresponding *attributes*, by importing them
         from a CSV file!.
         * Query the LDAP attributes of a particular entry, based on its DN. 
        
        At present, there are some features that I've planned, that aren't yet
        implemented. Hopefully, I'll do so in future releases!. 
        
        ## Requirements
        This is what it needs, in order to work:
         * [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
         * [python-ldap](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-ldap/) library (tested
        with *v3.2.0*).
        
        ## Disclaimer
        I don't take any responsibility on the consequences of the usage of this
        program!. Use it at your own risk!!.
        
        It's advisable to always have a working backup of your LDAP database, prior to
        ANY modification!.
        
        ## Installation
        The recommended way to install this program, is by using `pip`:
        ```
        pip install tiny-ldap-manager
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        To start with, here's the help output:
        ```
        usage: tiny-ldap-manager [-h] [-v] SERVER BINDDN {ls,modify,add,delete} ...
        
        Easily perform several LDAP operations
        
        positional arguments:
          SERVER                URI formatted address of the LDAP server
          BINDDN                DN of the user to bind the LDAP server
          {ls,modify,add,delete}
            ls                  List LDAP attributes for specified DN
            modify              Modify an LDAP attribute
            add                 Add LDAP entries from a CSV file
            delete              Delete an LDAP entry
        
        optional arguments:
          -h, --help            show this help message and exit
          -v, --version         Show current version
        ```
        ### Basic syntax
        The basic syntax you've to respect is the following:
        ```
        tiny-ldap-manager [SERVER] [BINDDN] [ACTION] [ARGUMENTS]
        ```
        In order of appearance:
         * `[SERVER]` belongs to the *URI formatted address* of your LDAP server. This
         argument is mandatory!.
         * `[BINDDN]` is the *DN* (*"Distinguished Name"*) of the LDAP user with
         permissions for the operation you wish to perform!. It's a mandatory argument!.
         * `[ACTION]` is the actual operation you want to perform. At present, there
         are four valid operations you can use: `ls`, `modify`, `add` or `delete`. This
         argument is also mandatory and you must provide ONLY one of them!. Please, see
         below for more details.
         * `[ARGUMENTS]`: when you perform an `[ACTION]`, any of them requires, at least, one
         or more additional arguments. You can add the `--help` argument to any of
         them, for specific details. Please, see below for more on this.
        
        ### Performing different LDAP operations
        
        #### Authentication
        Take into account that, an *authenticated session* is always assumed. So you are
        gonna be asked for the corresponding credentials, each time you perform an
        operation!.
        
        #### Listing attributes of an LDAP entry
        The `ls` action, allows you to quickly see the attributes of a particular LDAP
        entry. For this, you have to provide the DN of the latter. For example:
        ```
        tiny-ldap-manager ldap://192.168.100.5 "cn=config" ls "uid=joe,ou=people,dc=somecorp,dc=com"
        ```
        
        #### Modifying an attribute of an LDAP entry
        For modifying or adding an attribute to an LDAP entry, you logically use the
        `modify` action. There are three types of modifications possible to use:
         * `REPLACE` is to be used whenever you want to modify the value of an existing
         attribute. This is the mode **used by default**!.
         * `ADD` is for adding a non-existing attribute!.
         * `DELETE` is, of course, for deleting an existing attribute!. 
        
        ##### REPLACE mode
        If you don't provide any additional arguments, the `REPLACE` mode is used by
        default!. The complete syntax for it, is:
        ```
        tiny-ldap-manager [SERVER] [USERDN] modify [ATTRIBUTE] [VALUE] 
        ```
        Where `[ATTRIBUTE]` is the name of the *attribute* you want to modify, and
        `[VALUE]` is the *new value* for that *attribute*!.
        
        Let's see an example:
        ```
        tiny-ldap-manager ldap://192.168.100.5 "cn=config" modify "uid=joe,ou=people,dc=somecorp,dc=com" telephoneNumber "5555" 
        ```
        Above, we're modifying the existing `telephoneNumber` attribute with a new value
        of`5555`.
        
        Make sure that the new value for the attribute you're modifying, is NOT the
        same as its current value!. Otherwise, you'll get an error!.
        
        ##### ADD mode
        In order to use a different mode for making a modification, you've to do it
        using the `-M` argument, as follows: 
        ```
        tiny-ldap-manager ldap://192.168.100.5 "cn=config" modify -M ADD "uid=willy,ou=people,dc=somecorp,dc=com" telephoneNumber "8006666"
        ```
        With this latter example, we add the `telephoneNumber` attribute, with its
        corresponding value. 
        
        It's important to note that this program is *case-sensitive*, so the
        *modification mode* always goes with capital letters!.
        
        ##### DELETE mode
        Finally, an example for using the `DELETE` mode, for removing an existing LDAP attribute:
        ```
        tiny-ldap-manager ldap://192.168.100.5 "cn=config" modify -M DELETE "uid=charles,ou=people,dc=somecorp,dc=com" telephoneNumber ""
        ```
        Note that the *double quotes* at the end of the command, **are necessary!**.
        
        #### Adding entries to your LDAP
        The way to add entries to an LDAP database with `tiny-ldap-manager`, is by
        creating a CSV file using the header row (first row), to specify the attributes
        for each new entry. You must ensure that you use a *semi-colon* (`;`) as the CSV
        delimiter!.
        
        Besides the CSV *header row*, the rest of them, are to be used to define the
        value of each corresponding attribute.
        
        The order in which the LDAP attributes are specified in the CSV file, is not
        important, as long as there is a logical correlation between the *value* assigned
        to each *attribute* and the *attribute* itself!. Even then, for the sake of
        clarity, it's a good idea to always put the DN in the first place!.
        
        Now, let's see an example of a CSV file content:
        ```
        dn;objectClass;uid;cn;sn;givenName;displayName;mail
        uid=cdarwin,ou=people,dc=scileague,dc=org;['inetOrgPerson','organizationalPerson'];cdarwin;cdarwin;Darwin;Charles;Charles Darwin;charlesdarwin@scileague.org
        uid=alovelace,ou=people,dc=scileague,dc=org;inetOrgPerson;alovelace;alovelace;Lovelace;Ada;Ada Lovelace;adalovelace@scileague.org
        uid=aeinstein,ou=people,dc=scileague,dc=org;inetOrgPerson;aeinstein;aeinstein;Einstein;Albert;Albert Einstein;alberteinstein@scileague.org
        ```
        The following is how you would import such entries:
        ```
        tiny-ldap-manager ldap://192.168.100.5 "cn=config" add scileague.csv
        ```
        
        As you might noticed in the CSV, the entry that belongs to *Charles Darwin*, has
        a *formatted list* of *values* for the `objectClass` *attribute*. That's a
        supported way to include more than one *value* for a given *attribute*.
        
        As a final note about importing new LDAP entries, if one or many of them, already
        exist in the LDAP database, you can be sure that they won't be imported, but 
        equally important, is the fact that they won't interrupt the whole process
        neither. An output message is shown in each case.    
        
        #### Deleting an entry from your LDAP
        You can simply remove an LDAP entry from your database, by indicating its DN,
        as is shown next:
        ```
        tiny-ldap-manager ldap://192.168.100.5 "cn=config" delete "uid=bob,ou=people,dc=somecorp,dc=com"
        ```
        Poor Bob!. :)
