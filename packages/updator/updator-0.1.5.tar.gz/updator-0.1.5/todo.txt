TODO:

1. Add a file that will be contained all rules for each module. and when executing updator, updator will read the related module's rules and execute each one of the them.

3. Seperate to appropriate modules and classes. ðŸ¤—
4. Remove unnecessary code - not complete ðŸ™„
5. Fix remove node feature  ðŸ¤—
6. add more cases to check - as combined use of $n + $_... ðŸ™„
	and cases we wrote on the notebook... as remove params.. and so on
	
7. add test related to 1 - combined rules together.. ðŸ¤—

end - 2. Add the command line interface ðŸ™„
end - 1. consider add a structre id to each rule - weather it's a function, attr... and so on
 cause for example - the pattern "moduleName.atrrName" should change somwhow the attrName, but if a function has the same name, it will catch also that.
end. treat a case where the function is import above in a sentence of 'from lib import function'

What's next? list with order

6. Add more cases to check - as combined use of $n + $_... ðŸ™„
