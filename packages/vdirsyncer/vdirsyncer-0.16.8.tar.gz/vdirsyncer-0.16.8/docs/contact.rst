===================
Support and Contact
===================

* The ``#pimutils`` `IRC channel on Freenode <https://pimutils.org/contact>`_
  might be active, depending on your timezone. Use it for support and general
  (including off-topic) discussion.

* Open `a GitHub issue <https://github.com/pimutils/vdirsyncer/issues/>`_ for
  concrete bug reports and feature requests.

* Lastly, you can also `contact the author directly
  <https://unterwaditzer.net/contact.html>`_. Do this for security issues. If
  that doesn't work out (i.e. if I don't respond within one week), use
  ``contact@pimutils.org``.
