Description: # **Videomass** is a cross-platform graphical interface for FFmpeg and youtube-dl.
        Videomass is not a converter; it provides a graphical interface for writing presets and profiles to be used with [FFmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) without limits on formats and codecs; it also provides a basic graphical interface for [youtube_dl](https://pypi.org/project/youtube_dl/) video downloader. From the beginning, the main goal was to give it a high flexibility and expandability in the management and control of the presets and profiles in order to facilitate their use with the potential of FFmpeg.
        
        ## General Features
        - Multi-Platform, work on Linux, MacOs, Windows, FreeBsd.
        - Batch processing.
        - Advanced log management.
        - Multi language (English and Italian Languages support for now).
        
        ## Features with FFmpeg
        - Drag and drop to add multiple files simultaneously.
        - Fully customizable presets and profiles.
        - Possibility to create your new presets and profiles from scratch.
        - Has useful presets to start with.
        - Supports all formats and codecs available with FFmpeg.
        - Displaying information from streams analyzer.
        - Real-time video filters preview.
        - Three audio normalization modes: Peak, RMS and EBU R128.
        - Audio index from videos selectable to apply normalization.
        - Setting duration portions for imported files, filters, export and tests.
        
        ## Features with youtube-dl
        - Add multiple URLs simultaneously.
        - Download multiple URLs from YouTube and more sites.
        - Four download modes:
            - Default (choosing between 'best' or 'worst' qualities).
            - Download audio and video splitted.
            - Download Audio only (you can choose various formats).
            - Download videos and audio by 'format code' with audio merging.
        - View video information without downloading it (using youtube_dl library only).
        - Ability to playback individual URLs with different qualities via mpv player.
        - Ability to download all playlist.
        - Embed thumbnail in audio file (via atomicparsley).
        - Add metadata to file.
        - Write subtitles to video.
        
        
        ## Requirements
        - [Python >=3.7](https://www.python.org/)
        - [wxPython4](https://wxpython.org/) GUI framework.
        - [PyPubSub](https://pypi.org/project/PyPubSub/) Python Publish-Subscribe Package.
        - [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) On Windows and MacOS it is included with Python3.7
        - [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) >= 4.1.4
        - [ffprobe](https://ffmpeg.org/ffprobe.html) for multimedia streams analysis - should be included with FFmpeg.
        - [ffplay](http://ffmpeg.org/ffplay.html) for files playback - should be included with FFmpeg.
        - [youtube-dl](https://pypi.org/project/youtube_dl/) to download videos from the web
        
        ### Optionals
        - [mpv](https://mpv.io/) for previewing URLs in different formats and qualities.
        - [atomicparsley](http://atomicparsley.sourceforge.net/) if you want to embed thumbnail in audio file
        
        ## How to start Videomass
        Videomass can be run without installing it, just unzip the source archive and executing the "launcher" script inside the directory:   
        
        `python3 launcher`   
        
        Videomass can also be run in interactive mode with the Python interpreter, always within the same unpacked directory:   
        
        `>>> from videomass3 import Videomass3`   
        `>>> Videomass3.main()`   
        
        Keep in mind that on Linux a launcher should be even created in the application launcher of your desktop environment when installing Videomass with pip.
        
        On other systems such as Mac-Os and MS-Windows you will still have to open a console to run Videomass and just write `videomass` command. But if the command still doesn't work, you can start Videomass in interactive mode with the Python interpreter, as seen above.
