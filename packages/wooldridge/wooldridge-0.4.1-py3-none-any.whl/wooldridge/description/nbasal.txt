Collected by Christopher Torrente, a former MSU undergraduate, for a
term project. He obtained the salary data and the career statistics
from The Complete Handbook of Pro Basketball, 1995, edited by Zander
Hollander. New York: Signet. The demographic information (marital
status, number of children, and so on) was obtained from the teamsâ€™
1994-1995 media guides.
