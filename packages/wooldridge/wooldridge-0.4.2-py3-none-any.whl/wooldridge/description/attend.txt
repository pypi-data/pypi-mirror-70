These data were collected by Professors Ronald Fisher and Carl
Liedholm during a term in which they both taught principles of
microeconomics at Michigan State University. Professors Fisher and
Liedholm kindly gave me permission to use a random subset of their
data, and their research assistant at the time, Jeffrey Guilfoyle, who
completed his Ph.D. in economics at MSU, provided helpful hints.
