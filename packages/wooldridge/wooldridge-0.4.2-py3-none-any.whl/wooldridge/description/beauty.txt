Hamermesh, D.S. and J.E. Biddle (1994), “Beauty and the Labor Market,”
American Economic Review 84, 1174-1194. Professor Hamermesh kindly
provided me with the data. For manageability, I have included only a
subset of the variables, which results in somewhat larger sample sizes
than reported for the regressions in the Hamermesh and Biddle paper.
