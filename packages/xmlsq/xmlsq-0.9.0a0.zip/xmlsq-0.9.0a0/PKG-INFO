Description: A Python interface to xmlsq
        ==============================
        
        The utility **xmlsq** performs simple and full XPath 1.0 queries on an XML document.
        
        >>> import xmlsq
        >>> xml = r"<a><b foo='baz'>hello</b><b>world</b><e /></a>"
        >>> xmlsq.get_text(xml, "//b")
        'hello'
        >>> xmlsq.get_text(xml, "//b[2]")
        'world'
        >>> xmlsq.full_query(xml, "//b")
        '<b foo="baz">hello</b>\n<b>world</b>\n'
        >>> xmlsq.get_text(xml, "//b/@foo")
        'baz'
        >>> xmlsq.full_query(xml, "//b/@foo")
        'foo="baz"\n'
        >>> xmlsq.full_query(xml, "/a", xmlsq.Opts.RAW)
        '<a><b foo="baz">hello</b><b>world</b><e/></a>'
        >>> xmlsq.count(xml, "//b")
        2
        >>> xmlsq.count(xml, "//notthere")
        0
        >>> xmlsq.count(xml, "//e")
        1
        >>> xmlsq.full_query(xml, "2+3.5")
        '5.500000'
        
        `xmlsq.get_text()` extracts the text value of the *first* node found selected by the query.
        
        `xmlsq.full_query()` outputs the result of the full XPath 1.0 query as a string.
        
        `xmlsq.count()` computes the integer value of `count(query)`.
        
        For `xmlsq.get_text()` and `xmlsq.count()` the query *must* evaluate to a node.
