# xt-cv

## Description

This repo contains common models and utilities for working with ML tasks, developed by [Xtract AI](https://xtract.ai/).



More to come.

## Installation


From source:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/XtractTech/xt-models.git
pip install ./xt-models
```

## Usage


#### Grabbing a model

```python
from xt_cv.models import PSPNet

# Build an object populated with the COCO image list, categories, and annotations
model = PSPNet(sizes=(1, 2, 3, 6), psp_size=2048, deep_features_size=1024, backend='resnet50')
```

#### Implementing a new model

If you are having to always copy and paste the same model code for different projects, simply add the model code to the `models` directory, and import it in the `models/__init__.py` file.
